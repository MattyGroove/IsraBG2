@120  = ~Then the resemblance is uncanny, to say the least.~
@121  = ~I was in Eshpurta at the time... the Shield City, we call it. My own ancestral home, though I seldom have time or reason to visit anymore. Most of Amn's military operations are based there, however, and with the country on the brink of war...~

@128  = ~His ancestors were, once upon a time, but... no, not exactly.~
@129  = ~No. The Radiant Heart is a holy order, not a secular one, though they were likely involved as well. Father has worked with them before under similar circumstances.~
@130  = ~I am sure it was attempted. I would have gladly accompanied such a mission myself, had my father not flatly forbidden it.~
@131  = ~He was a general once, and though he has since retired, conflicts such as this... he is not exactly content to sit one out. I sometimes think we would get along better if he were.~
@132  = ~He was quite eager to see me sit it out, of course. He has never been entirely happy about my calling, and any opportunity to shield me from danger... he is quick to take it, I'm afraid.~

@134  = ~Surely he would have asked you to do something useful?~

@136  = ~Your order didn't have a problem with that?~
@137  = ~I expect there is some truth to that.~

@139  = ~Surpassingly, aye.~
@140  = ~'Twould have been difficult to refuse. There were important chores to be done in Eshpurta.~

@142  = ~I wish... truly, <CHARNAME>, I wish that you had been able to come to Amn under other circumstances. You deserved a warmer welcome than the one you received.~
@143  = ~This madness with Irenicus... 'tis a poor reward for everything you accomplished on the Sword Coast.~
@144  = ~Knowing Athkatla, even the warmest of welcomes would have strings attached.~

@147  = ~If you'd care to welcome me a bit more warmly, I certainly wouldn't refuse.~
@148  = ~Being rewarded is the last thing on my mind right now.~
@149  = ~That is likely true. Still, even the Athkatlan elite can be accommodating when they wish to be.~
@150  = ~I am sorry to hear it.~
@151  = ~(laugh) A single Athkatlan party ought to be enough for anyone.~
@152  = ~(laugh) I shall need to keep that in mind, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.~

@160  = ~Don't say such things, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.~
@161  = ~I don't mean to make little of your own trials, but recent days have been... frustrating, to say the least. This reunion...~
@162  = ~So many of my others as of late have been full of strife or unpleasant surprises. 'Twas naive of me, mayhap, but I had expected that *this* one at least would be uncomplicated by such things.~
@163  = ~Any more problems I'm likely to run into?~
@164  = ~You were going to go back to Eshpurta, weren't you?~
@165  = ~You really weren't kidding about that dysfunctional family.~
@166  = ~Naive indeed. You should know that I can't go a tenday without finding trouble.~
@167  = ~Oh? Forgive the intrusion, then.~
@168  = ~No. At least, I certainly hope not. I've told you that I meant to return to Eshpurta to speak with my father...~
@169  = ~I was, yes. I've told you that I meant to speak with my father...~
@170  = ~I would not jest about such things, <CHARNAME>. I've told you that I meant to return to Eshpurta to speak with my father...~
@171  = ~I am beginning to appreciate that, truly. Would that you were the only one. You know that I meant to return to Eshpurta to speak with my father...~
@172  = ~Even the return itself was strange, truth be told. I was never the most obscure of figures in Eshpurta, but news traveled more quickly than I did. Your name is now... quite popular there.~
@173  = ~Which is not to say that there were no elements who would have preferred war, but by and large, 'twas a rather enthusiastic homecoming.~
@174  = ~Did you hear any interesting songs or stories about us?~
@175  = ~I can't imagine you not being in your glory.~
@176  = ~I hope those 'elements' didn't give you any trouble.~
@177  = ~I'm glad at least one of us enjoyed the journey to Amn.~
@178  = ~Aye, though I doubt you would recognize them any more than I did.~
@179  = ~(laugh) For a short time, aye, though reality sunk in quickly enough.~
@180  = ~Not to my face.~
@181  = ~It was not entirely pleasant.~
@182  = ~My father... you might remember that I had meant to write home when we arrived in Baldur's Gate. My letter never reached him, though some of the stories certainly did.~
@183  = ~We... quarreled. Again. Whatever pride he might have initially felt... I could not say. I begin to think that he simply worries incessantly. And after spending most of his own life in combat, I cannot understand it.~
@184  = ~Fathers always think they know best. Gorion was the same.~
@185  = ~He didn't flatly forbid you, did he?~
@186  = ~I thought you were trying to reconcile with him.~
@187  = ~It's easier to risk your own life than to watch someone you love do so.~
@188  = ~Yes, I can believe that.~
@189  = ~Ah... no. He is somewhat adverse to giving commands that he knows will be disobeyed in any case.~
@190  = ~Trying... yes. It isn't the sort of thing one can simply wave a wand at, though. Would that I could.~
@191  = ~That may well be part of it.~
@192  = ~Needless to say, I was not terribly sad to bid farewell to Eshpurta again. I might have preferred to spend more than a fortnight in Crimmor afterwards, but such things cannot be helped.~
@193  = ~You'd get bored if you didn't have something important to do anyway.~
@194  = ~A bit of relaxation would be nice in general.~
@195  = ~You don't need to stay here if you don't want to, Isra.~
@196  = ~Not too long ago, I remember you being somewhat eager to be out in the world.~
@197  = ~That may well be so.~
@198  = ~Perhaps, though I suspect that the time for that has passed.~
@199  = ~I do want to. Even if I did not know and care for Imoen, I would never wish to simply abandon her to her fate. You should know that.~
@200  = ~I do want to. <CHARNAME>, I would never wish to simply abandon you to your fate at such a time. You should know that.~
@201  = ~That much has not changed, I admit.~
@202  = ~Needless to say, I was not terribly sad to bid farewell to Eshpurta again, and now that I find myself in your company once more instead...~
@203  = ~(smile) I missed you, <CHARNAME>... far more than I realized I would.~
@204  = ~Oh, do you? And exactly how much more might that be?~
@205  = ~The feeling is very mutual, I assure you.~
@206  = ~I distinctly recall a conversation we had in Baldur's Gate concerning... certain possibilities.~
@207  = ~That's flattering, but I think you may have the wrong idea about us.~
@208  = ~I am a Sunite, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. I must be allowed to keep some sense of mystery about me.~
@209  = ~That is most heartening to know.~
@210  = ~As do I... mayhap we shall need to discuss that again at some point.~
@211  = ~Ah. I see. Forgive me if I overstepped myself somewhat.~
@212  = ~I must say, my <PRO_LADYLORD>, you seem to have adapted remarkably well to the pace of life in Athkatla. Mayhap that should not surprise me, but I would never have believed that you were actually raised in a library.~ [rh#is111]
@213  = ~Candlekeep wasn't quite as secluded as everyone seems to think.~
@214  = ~I did spend quite a bit of time in Baldur's Gate as well.~
@215  = ~Just because I can survive Athkatla doesn't mean I like it.~
@216  = ~Isra, I'm a bit busy right now. Can't this wait?~
@217  = ~Perhaps I have misjudged it, then.~
@218  = ~Aye, though that says less about a person than where <PRO_HESHE> grew up.~
@219  = ~Even the skill itself is noteworthy. And rarer than you may realize.~
@220  = ~Aye, if you would prefer it.~
@221  = ~Forgive my curiosity, <CHARNAME>, but after a lifetime spent amongst Sunites and Lliirans, such a quiet upbringing... I can scarce imagine it. I never could sit still in a library, I'm afraid.~
@222  = ~You do seem a bit too active to enjoy a contemplative life.~
@223  = ~I never managed to sit still myself. You should hear the stories.~
@224  = ~The solitude suited me well. It gave me a chance to prepare myself.~
@225  = ~It wasn't as quiet as that. No place with its own barracks is.~
@226  = ~That is something of an understatement, but true enough regardless.~
@227  = ~I am sure that they would be well worth it.~
@228  = ~Truly? I would have expected excessively solitude to serve as a hindrance, though in your case, I would likely be wrong.~
@229  = ~Hmm. I should have realized that it would have a barracks. No, that certainly would make a difference.~
@230  = ~Loath as I am to admit it, I know very little about Candlekeep in general. I'm not certain that I even knew where it was before your own name made it famous. My knowledge of Sword Coast geography is... dismal, to say the least.~
@231  = ~(laugh) My sisters would tell you that I was too busy drawing pictures of knights and banners into the margins of my books as a child, and they would not be entirely wrong.~
@232  = ~As far as Candlekeep is concerned, you didn't miss much.~
@233  = ~I pity your former tutors, Isra.~
@234  = ~The monks of Oghma would never have let me get away with that.~
@235  = ~Knights and banners? Perhaps I shouldn't be surprised.~
@236  = ~I shall have to take your word for it.~
@237  = ~So do I, truth be told.~
@238  = ~I was broken of the habit relatively quickly myself, truth be told.~
@239  = ~No... I dare say you should not.~
@240  = ~(smile) Perhaps this is a poor time to indulge in memory, but I appreciate such conversation regardless. I shall need to tell you more about Crimmor at some point as well. 'Twas a very different experience than Candlekeep, I suspect.~
@241  = ~You were trained there, weren't you?~
@242  = ~If it's anything like Athkatla, I can believe it.~
@243  = ~Growing up in Amn must be an experience in and of itself.~
@244  = ~If you think I have time for more inane discussion, you're wrong.~
@245  = ~Aye, I was. The Firehair's faith is based there instead of Athkatla, and it seems to me that Crimmor is a better place because of it.~
@246  = ~But listen to me. I hardly need an excuse to prattle on about the city, I'm afraid. Consider yourself duly warned.~
@247  = ~'Tis less so than you might think, and thank Sune for that much. The Firehair's faith is based there instead of Athkatla, and it seems to me that Crimmor is a better place because of it.~
@248  = ~Aye, it can be, but I imagine that is true for any given country.~
@249  = ~I see. I'm sorry you feel that way.~
@250  = ~The month of Mirtul... oh, <CHARNAME>, finding you again now of all times seems such a cruel twist. We missed the Greengrass festivities by mere days.~ [rh#is112]
@251  = ~You're worried about parties at a time like this?~
@252  = ~Greengrass festivities? What are those?~
@253  = ~Not meeting at all would have been crueler by far.~
@254  = ~Isra, this really isn't a good time.~
@255  = ~'Tis more than a simple party, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. 'Tis one of my faith's holiest days.~
@256  = ~'Tis one of my faith's holiest days. We tend to celebrate it... thoroughly, to say the least.~
@257  = ~That is true, though I cannot help but regret missing one of my faith's holiest days.~
@258  = ~I see. Later, mayhap.~
@259  = ~This may seem a poor time to worry about such things, but when we parted in Baldur's Gate... 'twould be a lie to say that I had not entertained certain fantasies. I never expected them to come true, of course, but to come so close...~
@260  = ~(smile) Well, we have far more than a single festival throughout the year. If we have finished this quest by Midsummer, mayhap I can convince you to come with me to that celebration instead.~
@261  = ~Convincing me wouldn't take that much work, I assure you.~
@262  = ~Are you asking me out on a date, Isra?~
@263  = ~How many festivals do you actually have?~
@264  = ~I don't think that would be entirely appropriate, Isra.~
@265  = ~I shall need to remember that, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.~
@266  = ~That is not the way I would have put it, my <PRO_LADYLORD>, but... aye, I suppose I am.~
@267  = ~More than I could count, though these are our most important.~
@268  = ~I see. 'Twas not my intent to cause offense.~
@269  = ~Midsummer Night... I have only managed to attend it twice, I'm afraid. Two years past with a lover, and the year before that... well, a person who arrives alone in the evening is seldom still alone come morn.~
@270  = ~(smile) That is the case for most Sunite festivities, though 'tis doubly true for this one.~
@271  = ~You... with a stranger...? Really?~
@272  = ~Lovers, Isra? Is that what you see in our future?~
@273  = ~I wouldn't have to fend off the rest of your church for your favor, I hope.~
@274  = ~Isra, I'm really not comfortable with this conversation.~
@275  = ~Few people at any Sunite festival are strangers to me, my <PRO_LADYLORD>, though that is a hardly an appropriate question. You will need to forgive me for remaining silent on the matter. At least for a while longer.~
@276  = ~I am no diviner, my <PRO_LADYLORD>... and that is as much your decision as mine.~
@277  = ~I am more likely to have that problem than you are, unfortunately. Such handsome men are all too rare.~
@278  = ~Oh, I have a longer attention span than that, my Lady.~
@279  = ~The month of Mirtul... we missed the Greengrass festivities by mere days, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. That seems a cruel twist of fate.~ [rh#is113]
@280  = ~Fate was kind to let us meet at all, Isra. I wouldn't complain.~
@281  = ~This may seem a poor time to worry about such things, but there has been so little joy in your life as of late, and 'twill no doubt be even longer until we can afford such diversions again.~
@282  = ~(laugh) Perhaps that is for the best. I am not entirely sure that I would wish to attend any revel hosted in Athkatla anyway.~
@283  = ~You dislike the city that much?~
@284  = ~I didn't know you were so keen on festivals in the first place.~
@285  = ~I, for one, would jump at the opportunity.~
@286  = ~Have you ever been to one before?~
@287  = ~Suffice it to say that we court the favor of its nobility more than I might like.~
@288  = ~I go to less than you might think, though I would be a poor Sunite indeed if I avoided them altogether.~
@289  = ~I doubt that even you could bear the Athkatlan nobility for very long.~
@290  = ~In Athkatla? Once, aye. Suffice it to say that we court the favor of its nobility more than I might like.~
@291  = ~But forgive me, <CHARNAME>. I should not let myself get distracted by such fanciful thoughts. Not when we have so much to accomplish.~
@292  = ~I must confess, my <PRO_LADYLORD>, I know that you were forced into this life, but I cannot imagine you doing anything else.~ [rh#is114]
@293  = ~Would you have rather preferred a simpler existence instead?~
@294  = ~I've never thought of it. I've gotten used to the one I have.~
@295  = ~No. I spent life in Candlekeep preparing for the moment I could leave.~
@296  = ~Definitely. My plans never used to involve traipsing through dungeons.~
@297  = ~I try not to question what might have been. Nothing good can come of such thoughts.~
@298  = ~Isra, could we talk later instead?~
@299  = ~You certainly have. This lifestyle suits you exceedingly well.~
@300  = ~I cannot say that that surprises me. This lifestyle suits you exceedingly well.~
@301  = ~If you still feel that way, <CHARNAME>, you conceal it very well indeed. Truly, this lifestyle suits you more than I think you realize.~
@302  = ~Mayhap there is some truth to that. But despite whatever strain you may be feeling, <CHARNAME>, I think that this lifestyle suits you more than perhaps you realize.~
@303  = ~The things that you have accomplished, the things that you have endured... sometimes I wonder if you might not have been called to this life yourself. I am sure that this sounds like so much mystical nonsense to you, but to be as exceptional as you are...~
@304  = ~The things that you have accomplished, the things that you have endured... they should not surprise me, I know. This was no doubt a calling for you as much as it was for any of us, but you were still trained outside of any of the orders. To be as exceptional as you are...~
@305  = ~My <PRO_LADYLORD>, was there ever a moment when you simply knew that your life would take such a different track?~
@306  = ~I've always known that I was going to make something of myself.~
@307  = ~I never knew for sure, but I certainly always hoped.~
@308  = ~Anyone's life could take a different track, given the right motivators.~
@309  = ~I'm still looking forward to the day I can stop adventuring.~
@310  = ~No, you certainly do not lack for ambition.~
@311  = ~And not in vain, 'twould seem.~
@312  = ~Aye. Why some encounter those motivators and others don't, however...~
@313  = ~I see. 'Twould be a great loss, I think, but that is your choice to make.~
@314  = ~Forgive me my curiosity, <CHARNAME>, but I do sometimes wonder at the forces that drive other people into this life. I have spent so much time with the knights of the Ruby Rose, and our stories tend to be... quite similar.~
@315  = ~'Tis often said that becoming a paladin is a matter largely of destiny, that it is a calling rather than a choice. Many people discount such talk as romantic, self-righteous nonsense, of course, but the calling itself is... a very real thing. For me, at least.~
@316  = ~How so?~
@317  = ~And for me as well. When did you know?~
@318  = ~I never experienced anything like that myself. How would you describe it?~
@319  = ~Complete with the compulsory divine visions, no doubt.~
@320  = ~Don't you people ever get tired of thinking you're better than everyone else?~
@321  = ~We're all inclined to think that our own experiences are in some manner unique.~
@322  = ~'Tis a long story, and I was only seven years old at the time... young enough that I could not really say how true my memory of it still is.~
@323  = ~That was 1356, the year that Dragonspear Castle was finally purged... at least for a while. I am sure you have heard of it; the castle was infamous for its open portals to the Nine Hells.~
@324  = ~For certain? When I was a child of seven years, as strange at that might seem.~
@325  = ~That was 1356, the year that Dragonspear Castle was finally purged... at least for a time. I am sure you have heard of it; the castle was infamous for its open portals to the Nine Hells.~
@326  = ~'Tis possible that you simply did not recognize it as such, my <PRO_LADYLORD>, or mayhap you were never first pushed down a different path. As for how I would describe it... I was only seven years old at the time, so I could not really say how true my memory still is.~
@327  = ~(laugh) No, my <PRO_LADYLORD>, nothing quite so obvious, though one might say that devils were involved.~
@328  = ~I was only seven years old when I knew for certain. That was 1356, the year that Dragonspear Castle was finally purged... at least for a while. I am sure you have heard of it; the castle was infamous for its open portals to the Nine Hells, and the Baatezu that would issue forth at times.~
@329  = ~... I apologize if I have offended you in some way, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. Mayhap we should simply continue on.~
@330  = ~Mayhap, though I am not entirely convinced. I look at my sisters, both of whom chose... other lives, and I cannot help but wonder where exactly it was that our paths diverged so.~
@331  = ~I was only seven years old when I knew for certain. That was 1356, the year that Dragonspear Castle was finally purged... at least for a time. I am sure you have heard of it; the castle was infamous for its open portals to the Nine Hells.~
@332  = ~Seldom are Faerun's nations and city-states willing to work together, but to cleanse the old ruins, they made an exception. Baldur's Gate, Waterdeep... and Amn as well, I am proud to say. 'Twas my father's last serious campaign as a commanding general, and when he and his army marched home in victory--~
@333  = ~I normally see no beauty in warfare, but that day... that day I saw little else. You have likely never seen a victory parade before, so I can only say that the euphoria is... indescribable. All of Eshpurta was a-flush with celebration. All of Amn, mayhap, and likely of the Western Heartlands as well. Truly, my <PRO_LADYLORD>, 'twas more akin to a scene from a fairy-tale than to reality.~
@334  = ~My father had spent much of my early childhood campaigning, so I barely knew him at all, but in that moment... in that moment, I wanted to *be* him, <CHARNAME>. To be the center of that whirlwind of passionate celebration. 'Twas considered most unseemly for a girl of my age, of course, and everyone expected the infatuation to pass soon enough.~
@335  = ~You? Grow bored of something? As if that would ever happen.~
@336  = ~I take it that Amnian nobles don't like their daughters playing at war.~
@337  = ~I'd have expected that calling to be more spiritual in nature.~
@338  = ~Even for you, Isra, that's more than a bit vain.~
@339  = ~(laugh) They had reason to expect as much, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.~
@340  = ~No, not as such. Father understood it eventually, at least for a while, but at first... truly, they had reason to expect me to grow tired of it.~
@341  = ~(laugh) I am not altogether convinced that it wasn't. A deity's summons can be overwhelming and confusing for a child. Whatever it was, however, it... changed me in noticeable ways.~
@342  = ~(laugh) I was a child, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. Most children tend towards self-indulgence... though I will admit, I have never been able to dislodge the memory.~
@343  = ~I've been told that until that point, I had been a very... capricious child, given to picking up and abandoning hobbies with little warning or reason. My tutors considered me a menace, and everyone simply assumed that it would not be long before I grew bored of this newest fascination as well.~
@344  = ~(laugh) Obviously, I never did. The first flush of obsession passed, of course, and my father eventually managed to teach me discipline. Why things played out quite like that... I could not say for certain. Mayhap my destiny truly was tied so tightly to this path that none other could ever have hoped to hold my attention for long.~
@345  = ~ I have spoken with others since moving to Crimmor, and my story is far from unique. Of course, I do not know whether what is true for Sunites holds true for other faiths as well.~
@346  = ~That sounds more like madness than destiny, really.~
@347  = ~Do you really like the idea that you could never have happily done anything else?~
@348  = ~I still think there's an element of that in any calling, not just yours.~
@349  = ~I imagine that paladins of other faiths would be less likely to first hear their call amidst revelry and celebration.~
@350  = ~Madness would have been to refuse it, I think.~
@351  = ~It troubles me little. Sometimes I think that striving against the will of the gods is the only certain path to misery that there is. For anyone, not simply for me.~
@352  = ~I imagine that there may well be.~
@353  = ~(laugh) You clearly have never had the pleasure of meeting a member of the Harmonious Order, though I will otherwise concede you the point.~
@354  = ~Forgive me my nostalgia, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. You must be growing tired of listening to my maundering tale.~
@355  = ~On the contrary, I was quite enjoying the story.~
@356  = ~I never grow tired of listening to your voice, Isra.~
@357  = ~It was a bit less flashy than I was expecting.~
@358  = ~Well, yes, we probably should be moving on now.~
@359  = ~Then I'm glad to hear it.~
@360  = ~Regardless, we've spent more than enough time speaking as it is. Mayhap we should consider moving on now.~
@361  = ~(laugh) You are a charming one, I see.~
@362  = ~(laugh) Nor do I, apparently.~
@363  = ~(laugh) Such is reality, I'm afraid.~
@364  = ~Yes, I'm inclined to agree.~
@365  = ~Come, sit with me a while, <CHARNAME>. I would have you near me this evening.~ [rh#is115]
@366  = ~You look awfully pensive to<DAYNIGHT>, Isra.~
@367  = ~You should know by now that I would be delighted to.~
@368  = ~I was about to head to bed, actually. We can talk in the morning.~
@369  = ~(smile) I have been thinking, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.~
@370  = ~Do you still recall that night we spent in Baldur's Gate? There were many, I know, but this one... there was a minstrel playing, a talented young lady. And as splendid as she was...~
@371  = ~I would have stayed up all night with you listening had I thought I could afford it.~
@372  = ~I asked you to dance with me, as I recall.~
@373  = ~I... think I might have asked you to spend the night with me.~
@374  = ~I remember it as well, Isra. Very fondly.~
@375  = ~I can't say that I have any idea what you're talking about.~
@376  = ~I suppose so. Sleep well.~
@377  = ~Aye, and you were the perfect gentleman.~
@378  = ~Aye, and I told you to lead, and then... reneged on that. To the amusement of everyone else in the inn, I am sure.~
@379  = ~Aye, you did. You needn't be so bashful about it. Under other circumstances, I may well have accepted.~
@380  = ~I... had hoped that you would.~
@381  = ~Oh. I see. Forgive my nostalgia, then. Good night, <CHARNAME>.~
@382  = ~That night, <CHARNAME>... I know those days were not pleasant for any of us, but when I look back upon it now, I am astounded at how little has truly changed between us. And yet how much.~
@383  = ~One day you were simply some beautiful stranger, my <PRO_LADYLORD>, and then the next... your company has become as comfortable to me as my own.~
@384  = ~You and I, Isra, do you think perhaps...?~
@385  = ~You never told me that you felt that way.~
@386  = ~I've felt the same for quite some time, you know.~
@387  = ~Isra... I'm not sure I like where this is headed.~
@388  = ~I think... yes. Yes, I do.~
@389  = ~No... no, I did not.~
@390  = ~I... thought you had. I am sorry for not saying something sooner.~
@391  = ~When I left you in Baldur's Gate, I thought-- I could not say for certain, truth be told. That there was some strange nobility in leaving things unsaid and unspoken, mayhap. That if something was not perfectly timed, 'twas not meant to be at all.~
@392  = ~That was childish of me. I know that now.~
@393  = ~What exactly are you trying to say?~
@394  = ~What finally changed your mind? Seeing me again?~
@395  = ~I could have told you that months ago, Isra.~
@396  = ~Isra... I have to tell you that I don't feel the same.~
@397  = ~That I am... very fond of you. More than merely that.~
@398  = ~Amongst other things, aye.~
@399  = ~I do not think that I was ready to listen.~
@400  = ~Oh. Oh... I see. Forgive me the presumption, then. Good night, <CHARNAME>.~
@401  = ~I must be fully honest with you, <CHARNAME>. There are certain things I cannot offer you. Marriage, family...~
@402  = ~I must be fully honest with you. There are certain things I cannot offer you. Marriage, family... well, unless we were to do something quite unconventional, children are unlikely anyway, and perhaps that is for the best.~
@403  = ~Some consider such prospects compatible with a paladin's calling, but I don't. I have seen the toll that this lifestyle can take on a lover... I would not wish bind someone to me with vows as well.~
@404  = ~I doubt that such concerns are foremost on your mind at present, but you have the right to know.~
@405  = ~Then we just take each day as it comes?~
@406  = ~Thank you. That's actually a bit of a relief.~
@407  = ~I appreciate the honesty, and I can sympathize with your stance.~
@408  = ~Isra, sometimes your need for utter honesty is a bit of a mood killer.~
@409  = ~You wouldn't be binding me to a lifestyle I haven't already embraced.~
@410  = ~Don't speak in absolutes. You've changed your mind once already.~
@411  = ~I see. I'm sorry, but that does change things.~
@412  = ~I would prefer that, yes... and each night as well.~
@413  = ~Is it? I would not have expected it to be such a surprise.~
@414  = ~I thought you would be able to.~
@415  = ~I can't say that I'm too sorry about that.~
@416  = ~I know. And that may well make a difference in the end, though you should know that my stance is... somewhat unconventional.~
@417  = ~I'm more than willing to live in the present instead.~
@418  = ~It may be unconventional, but I understand it entirely.~
@419  = ~And you really never want children?~
@420  = ~So I see. I'm sorry, but that does change things.~
@421  = ~And I might again, should I survive another decade or so. In the meantime, however, all we have to work with is the present.~
@422  = ~That's more than acceptable.~
@423  = ~I understand. Really, I do. Good night, <CHARNAME>, and I pray that you find what you are looking for.~
@424  = ~I'm pleased to hear it. Very much so.~
@425  = ~Should I abandon them more often than not? Or risk orphaning them? I-- no, <CHARNAME>, that much is unlikely to ever change.~
@426  = ~I can more than sympathize with that.~
@427  = ~I never really thought about it that way.~
@428  = ~Well, I can't say I ever really wanted children anyway.~
@429  = ~It is something that deserves far more than a passing thought.~
@430  = ~Then I suppose that is one less concern.~
@431  = ~But 'tis growing late now, and I ought to retire shortly. If you would care to continue this conversation in a more... private venue, I certainly have no objection.~
@432  = ~Are you asking-- of course you are. I'd love to spend the evening with you.~
@433  = ~I... think it may be a bit too soon for that, my lady.~
@434  = ~How could I possibly turn down such a gracious invitation?~
@435  = ~You have no idea how long I've been waiting to hear those words.~
@436  = ~On second thought, I don't think this is a good idea. Any of this.~
@437  = ~I was hoping you would.~
@438  = ~Of course. I had no intention of making you uncomfortable, <CHARNAME>. Good night.~
@439  = ~Aye, how could you indeed?~
@440  = ~Oh, I think I have some idea, <CHARNAME>.~
@441  = ~Would you care to sit with me a while, <CHARNAME>? Your company... I would appreciate it this evening.~ [rh#is116]
@442  = ~How long would you say that we have been living out of taverns like this? I know we were apart for a time, of course, but that detail seems somewhat negligible now.~
@443  = ~It is a strange sort of life, isn't it?~
@444  = ~Living out of taverns? Normally we live out of tents instead.~
@445  = ~Months, Isra, though it seems like its own lifetime.~
@446  = ~I wouldn't consider your habit of gallivanting off to be negligible.~
@447  = ~I am not sure that I would say that, exactly. Truly, I think that I would be less comfortable with the alternative.~
@448  = ~Aye... and I cannot say that I care for that, though perhaps it makes the nights I can convince you to find an inn that much more precious.~
@449  = ~In this life, I would say that a few months *is* a lifetime... though I do not regret it a moment.~
@450  = ~Oh. I... did not realize that you were still upset over that.~
@451  = ~I was only teasing you, Isra.~
@452  = ~Apparently you thought wrong.~
@453  = ~I see. Perhaps "gallivanting" is not such a terrible description anyway.~
@454  = ~So I see. Forgive me, <CHARNAME>.~
@455  = ~It may well seem strange, but to spend each night in a different place, to sup alongside travelers from every corner of Faerun... I grew rather accustomed to it in Baldur's Gate, I think. And I am growing used to it again here.~
@456  = ~Before I met you, <CHARNAME>, my life was not quite so colorful. 'Twas colorful enough, certainly, but not like this. Mayhap I should thank you for that.~
@457  = ~At least one of us is enjoying the experience.~
@458  = ~You didn't frequent taverns as much before?~
@459  = ~And for the constant danger as well, no doubt.~
@460  = ~You want to thank me, do you? What exactly do you have in mind?~
@461  = ~(sigh) I should not have expected you to share my enthusiasm, though... I wish you did, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.~
@462  = ~Rural ones, aye. When we stay in a city, however, we are more likely to seek shelter in a temple instead. 'Tis an entirely different experience.~
@463  = ~(laugh) That is a fact of life regardless, I'm afraid.~
@464  = ~(laugh) Do not become greedy now, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.~
@465  = ~Those nights in Baldur's Gate... as dark as the days tended to be, as confusing and overwhelming as they often were, I think I shall always remember the evenings fondly.~
@466  = ~I hope... I hope that you will feel the same way about Amn one day, <CHARNAME>.~
@467  = ~I think that will depend upon how this quest ends.~
@468  = ~Do I really seem that miserable all the time?~
@469  = ~I am already feeling that way about Amn.~
@470  = ~I didn't realize that you thought so highly of the country.~
@471  = ~Then I shall pray that it ends well.~
@472  = ~Not all the time, certainly, though... sometimes, aye.~
@473  = ~Good. I am glad to hear it.~
@474  = ~As many problems as it has, it is still my home.~
@475  = ~I should retire shortly, though before I do, I did mean to tell you that I asked the barkeep about local bathhouses. There is apparently one relatively close by that comes highly recommended.~
@476  = ~Our Calishite style baths, <CHARNAME>... they truly are a treat.~
@477  = ~The inn's facilities aren't enough for you?~
@478  = ~Are they? I haven't been to a decent one in ages.~
@479  = ~As far as I'm concerned, a dip in a stream is enough of a treat.~
@480  = ~I can't imagine finding one in the slums.~
@481  = ~Thank you. I shall need to keep that in mind.~
@482  = ~They suffice, though I do suggest you try something more refined at some point. But for now... sleep well, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.~
@483  = ~Aye, I thought you would be glad to hear it. Good night, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.~
@484  = ~I... have noticed that, aye. I can only suggest that you try something more refined at some point. But for now... sleep well, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.~
@485  = ~Relatively close by, I said. Bernard's judgment is normally quite good. 'Tis worth at least considering at some point. But for now... sleep well, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.~
@486  = ~'Tis always such a welcome surprise to find true talent in establishments such as this, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. I trust you enjoyed the last performance.~ [rh#is117]
@487  = ~You're starting to get a bit starry-eyed there, Isra.~
@488  = ~Are you sure you wouldn't like a drink? I'd be happy to order something.~
@489  = ~Isra, you're watching that bard so intently, it's a wonder she's not getting nervous.~
@490  = ~As enjoyable as this evening has been, I need to get some sleep.~
@491  = ~(laugh) Aye, I do not doubt it.~
@492  = ~Quite sure, thank you. I have long since learned not to touch the stuff.~
@493  = ~(laugh) You have an odd definition of nervous, <CHARNAME>. She is quite clearly reveling in the attention.~
@494  = ~That would no doubt be a wise decision.~
@495  = ~We spend so much time in combat, I find it all too easy to forget how many other ways there are to bring a touch of brightness into this darkened world. Better ways, mayhap. Ways well worth defending, at the very least.~
@496  = ~That we can still bring ourselves to enjoy evenings such as this is a victory in and of itself, I think.~
@497  = ~And one I wish we could indulge in more often these days.~
@498  = ~You really are a hopeless romantic, aren't you?~
@499  = ~I'm usually too worried to have much of a taste for music.~
@500  = ~I'm surprised I've never seen you play an instrument yourself.~
@501  = ~'Tis little consolation, mayhap, but at least we know that the music still plays, even if we are not always so fortunate as to enjoy it.~
@502  = ~I am devoted to the Firehair, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. There is nothing hopeless about it.~
@503  = ~I do not blame you for that, <CHARNAME>, though cultivating an appreciation would likely do you well, particularly in times such as this.~
@504  = ~(laugh) I would never inflict such horror upon you, <CHARNAME>.~
@505  = ~Truly, sometimes I wish I were a better musician myself. My mother was a bard in her youth, aye, though I like to jest that my sisters inherited so much of her talent, there was little enough left over for me.~
@506  = ~I do not begrudge them their superior skill, of course, though... I admit that I would rather they had better nurtured their gifts.~
@507  = ~Neither really struck me as bardic material.~
@508  = ~Not everyone does exactly what we want them to.~
@509  = ~I can't believe that you don't have any musical talent whatsoever.~
@510  = ~The three of you have a pretty complicated relationship, don't you?~
@511  = ~They were once. Especially Rana.~
@512  = ~Aye, my <PRO_LADYLORD>, I am well aware of that.~
@513  = ~I have some training, I must admit, though I have never put it to great use.~
@514  = ~Aye... that would be something of an understatement.~
@515  = ~But this evening is too pleasant by far to focus on such thoughts. As strange as it may seem, to spend each night in a different place, to sup alongside travelers from every corner of Faerun... I am finding that I rather like it.~
@516  = ~Before I met you, my life was not quite so colorful. 'Twas colorful enough, certainly, but not like this. Mayhap I should thank you for that.~
@517  = ~What have you been doing with your time? Guarding temples?~
@518  = ~And you'll thank me for the constant danger as well, no doubt.~
@519  = ~(sigh) Aye, it comes with its hardships as well.~
@520  = ~Sometimes, aye, though I meant the diverse company. I have always been more likely to seek shelter in a temple instead.~
@521  = ~I ought to retire shortly, though before I do, I did mean to tell you that I asked the barkeep about local bathhouses. There is apparently one relatively close by that comes highly recommended.~
@522  = ~Have you ever seen anything that simply made you stop and think of Imoen for a brief moment? A girl's laughter, mayhap, or a thousand other possibilities, I imagine.~ [rh#is118]
@523  = ~I think of Imoen often enough without needing a specific reason.~
@524  = ~Occasionally, yes. How could I not?~
@525  = ~I try not to think about her whenever possible.~
@526  = ~Isra, I don't want to talk about her.~
@527  = ~As do I, but sometimes... occasionally something happens to catch me by surprise.~
@528  = ~How indeed... 'tis the same way with me.~
@529  = ~'Tis somewhat painful, I agree, but I would rather not let myself forget her.~
@530  = ~Oh. I see... I shall not make that mistake again.~
@531  = ~Several days ago, I saw a young woman who wore her hair in a style I had shown her once... a style she made me reproduce each morning for a tenday before she finally grew weary of it.~
@532  = ~And then today, I found a bottle of kohl she had ruined. I thought I had gotten rid of it, but apparently I had not.~
@533  = ~I never realized that she was ruining your things.~
@534  = ~Do you intend to keep it now?~
@535  = ~You always were such a favorite target for her.~
@536  = ~Sometimes I forget how much of a pest she could be at times.~
@537  = ~I never minded it overmuch, and now... now I almost long for it.~
@538  = ~Aye, I do. 'Tis a strange memento, but... an appropriate one, I think.~
@539  = ~I know. I never minded it overmuch, and now... now I almost long for it.~
@540  = ~Aye, though I almost long for it now.~
@541  = ~I never expected to miss finding her searching through by baggage in the evening, or the strange questions she would ask me at times, but... I do. More than I can say. Even her unwelcome advice...~
@542  = ~(smile) She used to like to tease me about you as well, <CHARNAME>. I do not know how she knew, but she did. Mayhap that should not surprise me either.~
@543  = ~"A handsome guy like that? He must be perfect for a Sunite," she would tell me. I simply brushed her off, of course, though now...~
@544  = ~"<CHARNAME> likes girls too, if that's what you're worried about," she would tell me. I simply brushed her off, of course, though now...~
@545  = ~I cannot help but wonder what she would say about us now.~
@546  = ~Probably something entirely inappropriate.~
@547  = ~She really said that about me?~
@548  = ~I'm sure she would just point out how right she had been.~
@549  = ~We'll find out soon enough. I'm sure of it.~
@550  = ~Quite likely. This once, however, I do not think that I would even mind.~
@551  = ~She was surprisingly discrete. I was always grateful for that much.~
@552  = ~And I would be more than willing to listen.~
@553  = ~I pray that you are correct. Truly, I do.~
@554  = ~(smile) I never expected to miss finding her searching through by baggage in the evening, or the strange questions she would ask me at times, but... I do. More than I can say.~
@555  = ~She only did it because it annoyed you, you know.~
@556  = ~Strange questions? I must have missed those.~
@557  = ~I'm beginning to miss the crazy antics as well.~
@558  = ~Don't sound so regretful, Isra. We will get her back.~
@559  = ~I do. But she was harmless enough despite that.~
@560  = ~Imoen could be very... irreverent... at times. 'Twas somewhat refreshing, truth be told.~
@561  = ~'Tis easy to view them fondly in retrospect.~
@562  = ~I know. At least, I certainly hope so.~
@563  = ~Situations such as this... they are never easy. One can eventually grow used to seeing loved ones in danger, but to be powerless to help them in any way... that is a different story entirely.~
@564  = ~I wouldn't say that. I dislike seeing you in danger.~
@565  = ~I haven't really grown accustomed to either yet.~
@566  = ~I wouldn't consider us powerless. We're doing everything we can.~
@567  = ~I know. We'll just have to weather it for a while longer.~
@568  = ~It helps to simply sit back and let things play out as they must.~
@569  = ~(smile) The feeling is very mutual, though 'tis something that we are both going to have to endure, I think.~
@570  = ~That is not necessarily a bad thing. It means that you still care.~
@571  = ~Perhaps I should have said instead that being absent can be more difficult, though I will not fault you on your composure.~
@572  = ~Aye. Hopefully it will be enough.~
@573  = ~That seems a dangerous philosophy, <CHARNAME>. Please, don't embrace it so.~
@574  = ~I wish that I could tell you more about the Cowled Wizards, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. Or anything, truly. I have several friends within the Athkatlan government, but even they have little to share.~ [rh#is119]
@575  = ~Your friend... I try not to worry overmuch about her, but I do not care for being so very in the dark.~
@576  = ~Neither do I. I grow more terrified about her each day.~
@577  = ~Worrying about it certainly won't get us anywhere.~
@578  = ~She can be a bit annoying, but she deserves better than this.~
@579  = ~You'd be surprised. I really couldn't care less.~
@580  = ~That can be difficult to remember at times.~
@581  = ~Aye, she does..~
@582  = ~I see. Forgive the presumption, then.~
@583  = ~If I may be so bold as to ask... what is she like? Given the effort you are putting into her rescue, she must be someone well worth knowing.~
@584  = ~She's my oldest friend. What can I do but put in the effort?~
@585  = ~I'm not sure you'd like her. She has... very sticky fingers.~
@586  = ~I wouldn't go that far. She was always a bit of a pest.~
@587  = ~Nothing ever seemed to get to her. Even if we do find her, that innocence will likely be gone.~
@588  = ~I know. I wouldn't expect you to do otherwise.~
@589  = ~So does my sister Alia. If it were her in danger instead, however...~
@590  = ~I see. 'Tis good of you to seek her out regardless.~
@591  = ~It may be, aye. There is always the risk of that.~
@592  = ~(sigh) I would advise you to prepare for the worst, my <PRO_LADYLORD>, but please, try not to expect it. Despair can be as dangerous a foe as any.~
@593  = ~I don't expect it. Imoen is stronger than she looks.~
@594  = ~How exactly do you even prepare for something like that?~
@595  = ~It's certainly one of the hardest to defeat.~
@596  = ~I'm no stranger to death, Isra. Far from it.~
@597  = ~Hopefully that will be enough.~
@598  = ~Training and discipline, I imagine. And practice.~
@599  = ~Aye, I know it.~
@600  = ~Aye, though that is no reason to grow hardened to it.~
@601  = ~Situations such as this... they are never easy. One can eventually grow used to seeing loved ones in danger, but to be powerless to aid them in any way... that is a different story entirely.~
@602  = ~Have you been through anything like this before?~
@603  = ~Like this precisely? No, but powerlessness comes in many varieties, and I do not care for any of them.~
@604  = ~That is true, though powerlessness comes in many varieties, and I do not care for any of them.~
@605  = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>, do you hear that music? Somebody must be entertaining with Lliirans to<DAYNIGHT>... I would know that song anywhere.~ [rh#is120]
@606  = ~I didn't realize you were so familiar with my faith's music.~
@607  = ~By the gods, Isra, you get excited at the strangest of things.~
@608  = ~I hear it. Does it have some special significant for you?~
@609  = ~It sounds pretty close. Would you like to go see what's going on?~
@610  = ~Isra, we don't exactly have time to listen to music right now.~
@611  = ~I am more so than you might realize, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.~
@612  = ~(smile) This song... I remember the Joybringers dancing to it the night that I stood vigil for knighthood. If I grow somewhat nostalgic at the sound of it, mayhap that is to be expected.~
@613  = ~That was only just recently, wasn't it?~
@614  = ~Why would Lliirans be involved in a Sunite vigil?~
@615  = ~I always thought vigils were supposed to be solemn affairs.~
@616  = ~Don't take this the wrong way, but you're the oddest paladin I've ever met.~
@617  = ~I have no wish to intrude upon a private party, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. I am content simply to listen.~
@618  = ~No... no, I suppose not. Later, mayhap.~
@619  = ~Aye, less than a tenday ere I met you in Athkatla.~
@620  = ~They were not. Not directly, at least.~
@621  = ~They often are, though I imagine it would depend upon one's faith.~
@622  = ~Am I? I am typical enough for one of my faith, I assure you.~
@623  = ~I shall need to show you our temple in Crimmor someday, I think. A more beautiful one I have never seen. We call it the Theater of Joy, and if that might seem an unusual name for a temple... well, ours is an unusual temple indeed.~
@624  = ~We share it with the clergies of Milil and Lliira, you see, each faith dominating a portion of the day. The arrangement seldom causes problems, but when the only Sunite temple in the area is transformed into a Lliiran festhall come nightfall...~
@625  = ~(laugh) I imagine you can guess how that might complicate a vigil.~
@626  = ~You seem less troubled by it than I might have expected.~
@627  = ~Could they not have held off for just one night?~
@628  = ~It's a good thing your goddess has a sense of humor.~
@629  = ~I assume this isn't a tale you want repeated in the presence of another paladin.~
@630  = ~I am hardly troubled by it at all.~
@631  = ~I would never have asked them to. 'Tis their temples as much as it is ours.~
@632  = ~Aye, though the impropriety was not as great as it might seem.~
@633  = ~I cannot imagine that anyone would be terribly surprised by it.~
@634  = ~I should not leave you believing that I was praying in the very midst of their revelry, of course. They did make accommodations for me, and even if it was impossible to block off the sound entirely...~
@635  = ~Well, we are Sunites. Some of our most sacred rites involve music. Why should this be any different? Others might prefer solemnity, but myself, I see little reason for it.~
@636  = ~You needn't convince me, Isra. I'm as much a Sunite as you are.~
@637  = ~You needn't convince me. The Morninglord's followers are not very different from the Firehair's.~
@638  = ~You needn't convince me, Isra. Obviously we Lliirans are the same.~
@639  = ~Amongst Helm's faithful, we value few things more highly.~
@640  = ~Profundity comes in many forms, it would seem.~
@641  = ~On any other tongue but yours, those words would come across as frivolous.~
@642  = ~This is just one more thing I will never understand about your faith.~
@643  = ~(smile) Of course. I did not mean to sound so defensive. That night... I still find myself overwhelmed simply thinking of it.~
@644  = ~I know. And I will not deny that it has its place, but a night like that one... 'twas perfect as it was.~
@645  = ~(smile) Aye, and that night... 'twas profound indeed.~
@646  = ~I shall take that as a compliment, my <PRO_LADYLORD>, and not a criticism. That night... I still find myself overwhelmed simply thinking of it.~
@647  = ~Mayhap not. I shan't deny that solemnity has its place, but a night like that one... 'twas perfect as it was.~
@648  = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>... would that I could describe it to you properly. People so often assume that our lives are full of divine visions and revelations, and mayhap for other people, that is true, but myself... I have never been so lucky before.~
@649  = ~To actually feel her favor that intimately... the glory of it was indescribable. I remember the song that was playing when it began, obviously, but after that... it might have been moments or hours later, I couldn't tell you. The sheer beauty of it, however...~
@650  = ~I am sorry, <CHARNAME>. I must be sounding hopelessly mystical to you now.~
@651  = ~Would I be here with you now if I didn't like mystical?~
@652  = ~I'm more than used to it by now, I assure you.~
@653  = ~I... sometimes I wonder how mortal love can compare to that, Isra.~
@654  = ~I'm no stranger to divine dreams... though mine aren't quite so nice.~
@655  = ~(laugh) I cannot argue with that.~
@656  = ~(laugh) I imagine you would have to be.~
@657  = ~(sigh) Mortal and divine love, my <PRO_LADYLORD>... they are different things entirely. The one does not detract from the other. Quite the opposite, truly.~
@658  = ~Oh. Oh, of course. Forgive me... I should have remembered as much.~
@659  = ~But come, that is enough talk for to<DAYNIGHT>. Had we more than a moment to spare, I would likely beg a quick dance of you.~
@660  = ~Since it seems that we do not, I shall have to settle for a kiss instead.~
@661  = ~Even if I had the words to describe it... some things are too private, I think. Suffice it to say that there was enough beauty in that one night to last a lifetime.~
@662  = ~<CHARNAME>, I am beginning to think that I might have left you with a somewhat uneven impression of a Sunite knighting.~ [rh#is121]
@663  = ~I'm afraid I can't remember anything from before you started kissing me.~
@664  = ~I take it there was more to it than music and visions?~
@665  = ~Uneven? It seemed fittingly Sunite to me.~
@666  = ~I suspect there were formalities involved at some point.~
@667  = ~I don't have time to talk right now. Later, maybe?~
@668  = ~(laugh) Then you have a very selective memory, my love. But there were formalities as well. We have our own ceremonies, just as any other order would.~
@669  = ~Aye, there were formalities as well. We have our own ceremonies, just as any other order would.~
@670  = ~It certainly was, though there were formalities as well. We have our own ceremonies, just as any other order would.~
@671  = ~Aye, we have our own ceremonies, just as any other order would.~
@672  = ~Of course. As you wish.~
@673  = ~It was not terribly large, of course. There are not that many of us in Amn, and we are seldom ever gathered in one place, even for knightings.~
@674  = ~Still, Sir Evendur, my mentor... 'twas nice to see him again, and under pleasant circumstances for once. I... think we both needed that.~
@675  = ~Was he the one who knighted you?~
@676  = ~I believe you've mentioned him once or twice.~
@677  = ~You've been very worried about him, haven't you?~
@678  = ~At least someone here gets pleasant circumstances from time to time.~
@679  = ~You've never said exactly what happened to him.~
@680  = ~No, he wasn't. That was the Prelate's responsibility, and Sir Evendur-- he is no longer fit for service, I'm afraid.~
@681  = ~I have. He is... often on my mind as of late.~
@682  = ~I have been. Times have been difficult, to say the least.~
@683  = ~I know that things have not been very easy for you as of late, <CHARNAME>. You are not the only one, I'm afraid.~
@684  = ~There was an... incident... early last year involving a green dragon on the eastern edge of the Snakewood. We had not expected to find one there. Sir Evendur managed to slay the beast, but the price was... very high.~
@685  = ~Much of the damage was mendable, but his arm... there was nothing that could be done for that. Forced retirement is a cruel fate for any paladin, and for a Sunite-- better to lose his arm than his face, he jests, but I know he doesn't mean it.~
@686  = ~I'm sorry, Isra. That's terrible.~
@687  = ~At least he can joke about it.~
@688  = ~You never told me you'd taken on a dragon before.~
@689  = ~I can't imagine disfigurement goes over well in the Church of Sune.~
@690  = ~Yes... yes, it was.~
@691  = ~I know.~
@692  = ~I was only a squire. My only contributions were keeping out of the way and... getting him to safety after the fact.~
@693  = ~Not always, no. He tends to avoid the Heartwarders now. Their pity can be harder to bear than their scorn.~
@694  = ~Forgive me, <CHARNAME>. That was a morbid digression.~
@695  = ~Whatever might have come before, 'twas good to find him in better spirits again. I have not had the chance to see as much of him as I would like. Or of anyone else, really.~
@696  = ~Alia was at the ceremony as well, and our mother never needs an excuse to visit Crimmor. Father was too busy, given the recently averted war, but he did send gifts in congratulations.~
@697  = ~Your other sister didn't show up?~
@698  = ~He should have taken the time out for something like that.~
@699  = ~Yes, that ring you guard so jealously.~
@700  = ~Was this just a church and family affair?~
@701  = ~I'd have loved to have been there myself.~
@702  = ~No... she did not. Her excuses made less sense than our father's, but I saw little point in pressing the issue.~
@703  = ~He does have other responsibilities, and I see little point in pressing the issue with him anyway.~
@704  = ~Aye, 'twas an heirloom I never expected to receive.~
@705  = ~Traditionally, aye, though my closest friends within the Church of Lliira were there as well.~
@706  = ~Aye, I would have liked that as well.~
@707  = ~(sigh) 'Tis strange, sometimes, what weight ceremonies hold for us... one can spend a lifetime in preparation, and then the event itself is over in a moment.~
@708  = ~Now, <CHARNAME>... 'tis like being wakened from a dream. A very long, very comforting dream. I do not always know what to make of that.~
@709  = ~I think that's called growing up, Isra.~
@710  = ~You wouldn't rather go back, would you?~
@711  = ~That was Candlekeep for me. You didn't have one settled home, though.~
@712  = ~That's the danger of defining yourself through titles and ceremonies.~
@713  = ~I suspect that is true enough.~
@714  = ~No... no, never that.~
@715  = ~No... I suppose I did not. Hmm. That is an interesting thought.~
@716  = ~Mayhap, though I suspect that the sensation is more universal than that.~
@717  = ~But forgive my strange fancies, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. This is too fine a <DAYNIGHT> to waste entirely upon such notions.~
@718  = ~'Tis strange to think how little time has actually passed since we were in Baldur's Gate. So much has changed, it almost seems like another lifetime.~ [rh#is122]
@719  = ~It's been longer than you realize, I think.~
@720  = ~A better lifetime. I miss the simplicity of it.~
@721  = ~Some of those changes have been for the better.~
@722  = ~Life moves more quickly when you're on the road like this.~
@723  = ~I suppose that is true, though the memory is still clear enough. Too clear, mayhap, if somewhat dreamlike at times.~
@724  = ~I do not recall it being too much simpler. Quite the opposite at times, though 'twas certainly different.~
@725  = ~(smile) Aye, and one in particular... one I would have no wish to ever take back, though several of the others still trouble me at times.~
@726  = ~I would have to agree, especially concerning our recent adventures.~
@727  = ~Nashkel just seems so far away now, and in more ways than the physical. The things we didn't know then, about ourselves, about the world in general... 'twould take a bard to recount them all.~
@728  = ~I think a book of prophecy would suffice in my case.~
@729  = ~Well, we needn't look very far to find one of those.~
@730  = ~What do they say, ignorance is bliss?~
@731  = ~You don't miss it, I hope. I'd rather know what's going on.~
@732  = ~Why so pensive all of a sudden?~
@733  = ~I know. I wish it were otherwise.~
@734  = ~No, indeed, we needn't. And you have more tales to tell than most.~
@735  = ~Is it? I am not so sure.~
@736  = ~No, I don't miss the ignorance. Not really.~
@737  = ~I have been thinking about our brief, ill-fated visit to Candlekeep fairly often recently, I must admit. Why now, I could not say. Perhaps I am simply more predisposed towards nostalgia as of late.~
@738  = ~It's not the easiest of things to forget.~
@739  = ~"Nostalgia" may be the wrong word to apply to that mess.~
@740  = ~You're not getting nervous about my heritage again, are you?~
@741  = ~Gorion's letter... you were almost more upset about it than I was.~
@742  = ~No, it really is not. Still, I have had some time now to get used to the truth of your parentage. Enough time to consider it rationally, at least.~
@743  = ~No, that particular memory is far from pleasant. Still, I have had some time now to get used to the truth of your parentage. Enough time to consider it rationally, at least.~
@744  = ~No more than I usually am. Less, mayhap. I have had some time now to get used to the truth of it. Enough time to consider it rationally, at least.~
@745  = ~I could have handled it better, I know. Still, I have had some time now to get used to the truth of your parentage. Enough time to consider it rationally, at least.~
@746  = ~I cannot say I know much more now than I did then, but this world is full of strange and unusual stories. Not all of them end pleasantly, but more than a few end in ways even the prophets couldn't have predicted.~
@747  = ~Destiny can be a tricky thing. I trust myself and my companions, not the sages.~
@748  = ~You don't think that Alaundo's prophecies will come true?~
@749  = ~I'm not worried about a prophet's predictions. I'm worried about a god's intentions.~
@750  = ~This isn't one of your Sunite fairytales, Isra. This is uglier than that.~
@751  = ~That is a sensible outlook, I think.~
@752  = ~Truly, I could not say. I think what you believe is more important than what I do.~
@753  = ~And I don't mean to make light of what is at stake. Far from it.~
@754  = ~That makes the words more necessary, not less.~
@755  = ~I have not always been as supportive in this as I could be, I know. I am not sure what I was expecting at first. Perhaps the problem was that I did not know what to expect at all.~
@756  = ~That much hasn't changed, but everything else, <CHARNAME>... every day I believe more strongly that you can overcome this curse.~
@757  = ~I envy your faith. I seldom feel the same.~
@758  = ~I wouldn't call it a curse. Divine blood is divine, whatever its origin.~
@759  = ~I hope that happens before someone finally takes my head off because of it.~
@760  = ~Thank you, Isra. I need to hear that every so often.~
@761  = ~I will because I have to. The only alternative is defeat.~
@762  = ~So you don't think I'm about to sprout wings or anything?~
@763  = ~Try to. Despair is a dangerous enemy, and you have more than enough of those as it is.~
@764  = ~I know. And I would repeat the words every night if I thought it would help you to believe them... despair is a dangerous enemy, and you have enough of those as it is.~
@765  = ~Whatever benefits it may bring, never forget that there is a price attached. What that will prove to be... I could not say.~
@766  = ~Don't say such things, <CHARNAME>. Please, don't. That line of thought... you will not like its destination. Neither of us will.~
@767  = ~Aye... there are certainly enough people making the attempt.~
@768  = ~That won't happen. Not while I still have breath in my body, at least.~
@769  = ~(smile) I know. And I can repeat it as often as you would like.~
@770  = ~Aye, and that is no alternative at all.~
@771  = ~(laugh) I should certainly hope not. That could prove awkward.~
@772  = ~I have... heard several rumors, <CHARNAME>. Rather, I heard them some time ago, but it never seemed an appropriate subject to broach.~ [rh#is123]
@773  = ~It probably isn't any more appropriate now.~
@774  = ~Of course. I was wondering when this was going to come up.~
@775  = ~What type of rumors?~
@776  = ~I don't want to talk about it.~
@777  = ~Perhaps not, but I must speak.~
@778  = ~If I may be very blunt, there were a few ugly stories told in Eshpurta concerning your heritage. I thought them mad at first, but now that I know you better...~
@779  = ~<CHARNAME>, are you related to Bhaal? The dead god of murder?~
@780  = ~He was my father, unfortunately.~
@781  = ~And if I am? Your reaction isn't going to be drastic, I hope.~
@782  = ~As far as I'm aware, there are no other Bhaals.~
@783  = ~No. You shouldn't listen to insane rumors. It's not true.~
@784  = ~I don't blame you, but I must speak.~
@785  = ~I see. I had hoped it mere gossip.~
@786  = ~No, of course not. Nothing of the sort.~
@787  = ~Thank the gods for that much, at least.~
@788  = ~I understand your reticence, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. If you would rather not speak of it, I shan't force you.~
@789  = ~This may seem an odd time to bring such a thing up, but 'tis a conversation that I have avoided for far too long already.~
@790  = ~I... do not have to be worried, do I? Fiends may mate with mortals, but I can think of no precedent for this sort of heritage.~
@791  = ~I'm not about to turn into a dragon or anything, Isra.~
@792  = ~You seem less upset about this than I'd have expected.~
@793  = ~And if I say that you should worry?~
@794  = ~You only need to worry about the people out to kill me because of it.~
@795  = ~That is... somewhat encouraging, I suppose.~
@796  = ~I have had some time to consider the possibility now. This is not exactly a surprise.~
@797  = ~Then... then I would want to know what I could do to help you.~
@798  = ~Aye, and I imagine there have been more than a few.~
@799  = ~Please, <CHARNAME>, do not mistake me. I've no wish to judge you or see you harmed because of this... this cruel twist of fate.~
@800  = ~Whatever else you might be, you are no monster. Far from it. I know you well enough to know that much, at least.~
@801  = ~Your support is certainly appreciated.~
@802  = ~You know me now. Who can say what tomorrow may bring?~
@803  = ~I'm not a monster? Gee, thanks for the insight, I guess.~
@804  = ~From you, Isra... from you, that means a lot.~
@805  = ~It's a pity everyone isn't quite as tolerant about it.~
@806  = ~It's a pity that the Harper Galvarey wasn't quite as tolerant about it.~
@807  = ~I had hoped that it would be.~
@808  = ~I know. The thought does trouble me occasionally, though not as much as it might.~
@809  = ~I'm sorry. 'Twas hardly my intent to patronize you.~
@810  = ~(smile) You are a good <PRO_MANWOMAN>, my <PRO_LADYLORD>... you deserve better than this lot you've received. Far better.~
@811  = ~I know. Life has been far from easy for you.~
@812  = ~I know. Men such as that are far more common than I would like.~
@813  = ~You were fortunate, I think, to at least have a mentor like Gorion. Everyone has to learn to bear the harsher realities of life eventually, and too few find proper guidance along that path.~
@814  = ~I imagine that even having it does not always help.~
@815  = ~Trust me, he was less encouraging than you think.~
@816  = ~I'm grateful for his tutelage every day.~
@817  = ~I'm not most people.~
@818  = ~A bit more optimism, my lady. Don't go suddenly glum on me.~
@819  = ~Mayhap not, though he clearly did something right.~
@820  = ~Aye, as you should be.~
@821  = ~No... no, you are not.~
@822  = ~I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>. That was hardly my intent.~
@823  = ~You have been in Amn for some time now, <CHARNAME>, certainly long enough to have formed an opinion. Might I ask what you think of it?~ [rh#is124]
@824  = ~I hope you won't be upset with me if I say I can't stand it.~
@825  = ~I find the country quite fascinating, actually.~
@826  = ~It gave me you, Isra. How can I help but love it?~
@827  = ~I think it's the most corrupt place I've ever seen.~
@828  = ~Isra, I don't have time for this right now.~
@829  = ~No. I would prefer an unpleasant truth to a lie, and the sentiment is not entirely unexpected, I must admit.~
@830  = ~Do you? I am glad to hear it. Amn has so many poor qualities, 'tis common enough for people to ignore its better ones.~
@831  = ~(smile) If my company distracts you from the uglier truths of this country, 'tis something to be grateful for.~
@832  = ~There are worse countries, though Amn... I must admit, it has certainly earned its place amongst them.~
@833  = ~Oh. I see. Very well, then, perhaps we can speak again later.~
@834  = ~Too much time spent in Athkatla can sour anybody on the country as a whole. The city is not exactly known for being overly welcoming to strangers. Unless, of course, said stranger has exceptionally deep pockets.~
@835  = ~And a willingness to show off that wealth, no doubt.~
@836  = ~Can you truly say that the rest of Amn is any different?~
@837  = ~It doesn't seem to treat its own citizens too kindly either.~
@838  = ~Plenty of other cities are the same way.~
@839  = ~Aye, that is certainly helpful as well.~
@840  = ~In my own experience, it is, though I am somewhat biased in the matter.~
@841  = ~No... no, it does not.~
@842  = ~I know, though Athkatla is closer to home for me than most.~
@843  = ~This city... I am more acquainted with its aristocracy than I would like. Any paladin can find herself treated as a status symbol from time to time, but those of us affiliated with the Ruby Rose... we are considered particularly fine ornamentation.~
@844  = ~I--I should not speak so bitterly, of course. 'Tis most ungracious of me.~
@845  = ~I thought you would be more amenable to social functions than this.~
@846  = ~I take it that they're not exactly the best dinner hosts.~
@847  = ~You don't need to wear that mask of utter courtesy around me, Isra.~
@848  = ~You don't need to be so courteous all of the time.~
@849  = ~You're more amusing company when you're not being overly gracious.~
@850  = ~I am, though in Athkatla, I grow weary of the inevitable snide remark.~
@851  = ~No, I am afraid not.~
@852  = ~'Tis hardly a mask, <CHARNAME>, but... no, I do grow frustrated at times.~
@853  = ~I should at least try, though... no, I do grow frustrated at times.~
@854  = ~Then you must be very fond of seeing me in Athkatla.~
@855  = ~(sigh) They are not bad people... at least, not all of them are. And many follow my own faith, though some of those seem to have developed a very selective interpretation of the Firehair's dogma.~
@856  = ~Most people tend to pick and choose, whatever their religion.~
@857  = ~And reflect poorly upon the entire religion, no doubt.~
@858  = ~That's their own loss, I would say.~
@859  = ~Athkatlans don't seem like they'd have much use for a goddess of love.~
@860  = ~It's not that selective. You're all obsessed with appearances.~
@861  = ~I cannot disagree with that.~
@862  = ~At times, mayhap.~
@863  = ~I would have to agree.~
@864  = ~No, though an appreciation for beauty is common enough.~
@865  = ~I see. I did not realize that you thought so poorly of us.~
@866  = ~Calm down, I was just teasing you.~
@867  = ~Not of you, of course, but you're something of an anomaly.~
@868  = ~You must not be paying much attention.~
@869  = ~That is an exceedingly poor jest, <CHARNAME>. Perhaps we should simply continue on for now.~
@870  = ~Am I? How very kind of you, <CHARNAME>. Perhaps we should simply continue on for now.~
@871  = ~So it would seem. I shan't make that mistake again.~
@872  = ~So it would seem.~
@873  = ~Excuse me, <CHARNAME>. I wasn't simply looking for an excuse to complain about Athkatla, and I'm sure you don't care to listen to it.~
@874  = ~I don't mind at all.~
@875  = ~That barely counted as complaining, Isra.~
@876  = ~You're allowed to not like everyone, you know.~
@877  = ~No, I really don't.~
@878  = ~Even so. Perhaps we should simply continue on for now.~
@879  = ~Then perhaps we should simply continue on for now.~
@880  = ~This is a poor time to be indulging in regret, I know, but Rana... she and I were close once, as difficult as it may be to believe it now.~ [rh#is130]
@881  = ~She won't hate you forever, Isra.~
@882  = ~Imoen and I were close like that too, once upon a time.~
@883  = ~Can't you at least visit her in prison?~
@884  = ~I'm sorry, but I don't have time for this.~
@885  = ~Won't she? Would that I could believe that.~
@886  = ~I know. I never expected to find myself envying your situation, but... at least your friendship has not been poisoned.~
@887  = ~I would ask, though I doubt that she would even see me.~
@888  = ~I see. Then... later, mayhap.~
@889  = ~If I could redo the past five or six years... by Sune, my relationship with Alia may have always been somewhat difficult, but 'twas different with Rana. She was the eldest. When we were children, she took that seriously.~
@890  = ~Alia did not make it easy for her. She used to feed me fanciful stories, trying to get me to do foolish things. Our tutors kept me out of trouble as much as they could, but Rana was the only one I would actually listen to.~
@891  = ~What type of foolish things?~
@892  = ~You did say you were a mess before you heard your calling.~
@893  = ~Your parents weren't around?~
@894  = ~Nostalgia is a funny thing, isn't it?~
@895  = ~The type that should likely have gotten me killed. Eshpurta is no place for such nonsense.~
@896  = ~Aye, I was. And Eshpurta is no place for such nonsense.~
@897  = ~Father was away on campaign more often than not, and mother was usually engrossed in her own projects. Eshpurta was something of a playground for me. A very dangerous playground.~
@898  = ~Aye. Truly, strange as it may seem, sometimes I miss Eshpurta.~
@899  = ~Rana always hated the city, of course. Father was harder upon her than upon Alia or myself. She was an exceedingly skilled musician, and he did not consider that an appropriate profession for his firstborn child... especially when it became clear that there would be no sons.~
@900  = ~He is... very Calishite in some ways. He wanted all of us married off as soon as possible, and Rana... she was so eager to be gone, I suspect that she accepted the first serious offer without a second thought.~
@901  = ~In her defense, the offer did come with a nice estate.~
@902  = ~And that came from the Jysstevs, I take it.~
@903  = ~I didn't realize people married so young here.~
@904  = ~That doesn't sound terribly romantic.~
@905  = ~I'm beginning to understand why you're so hesitant about marriage.~
@906  = ~Little consolation though that is in the end.~
@907  = ~It did. Our mother's family name is a powerful bargaining chip, even in Athkatla.~
@908  = ~Were we in Calimshan, I would be disgraced for my lack of a husband. We are not so bad about it in Amn, but the tendencies remain.~
@909  = ~I would have to agree, though I could not say for certain what passed between them.~
@910  = ~I am not sure that the two are related. I would like to think that most end successfully, though this one...~
@911  = ~I must admit, I know less about their marriage than I should. I was away when she was was betrothed, but when I finally met him at the wedding, he was jealous. Controlling. He thought it socially unacceptable for one's wife to be a minstrel.~
@912  = ~I could not help but think that Rana was trading one unfortunate situation for another. I... could not help but say as much.~
@913  = ~You mean at the wedding?~
@914  = ~He didn't seem nearly that bad to me.~
@915  = ~Why would she even accept that?~
@916  = ~I don't really blame you for that.~
@917  = ~I am afraid so.~
@918  = ~Mayhap he has changed in the time since, or mayhap I misread him even at the beginning.~
@919  = ~I do not know. Mayhap there was more to it than I thought, or mayhap I simply saw what I wanted to see. What I expected to see. Mayhap she even loved him.~
@920  = ~I could not say whether I was right or wrong to think so poorly of him. I have never been very welcome amongst the Jysstevs since, and until recently, I was too proud to visit anyway.~
@921  = ~Had I done otherwise... I don't know. 'Tis impossible to say what might have been, but I can't help but regret the years of silence now.~
@922  = ~If you truly were close, you'll be okay again eventually.~
@923  = ~Her choices were her own. You're not responsible for them.~
@924  = ~I can certainly sympathize with that.~
@925  = ~It doesn't do any good to dwell upon it, Isra.~
@926  = ~I wish there were something I could say to make this better.~
@927  = ~I hope so, but... I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>. I don't mean to burden you with such troubles.~
@928  = ~No... no, I know that much. I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>. I don't mean to burden you with such troubles.~
@929  = ~I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>. I don't mean to burden you with more troubles.~
@930  = ~No... no, it does not. I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>. I don't mean to burden you with such troubles.~
@931  = ~I know, <CHARNAME>, and that... truly, even that is enough.~
@932  = ~I never said exactly what happened at the courts, did I?~ [rh#is131]
@933  = ~Not in as many words, no.~
@934  = ~I assumed you didn't want to.~
@935  = ~I'll admit, I have been a bit curious.~
@936  = ~No, and I'd rather leave it like that.~
@937  = ~'Twas too soon earlier, but now... enough time has passed.~
@938  = ~Earlier I did not, but now... enough time has passed.~
@939  = ~I imagined you might be. 'Twas too soon earlier, but now... enough time has passed.~
@940  = ~Of course. I have dwelled upon it too much as it is.~
@941  = ~'Twould be otherwise, perhaps, if I expected her to remain in prison for very long, but I don't. It is no secret that Lady Lamia can call in any number of favors. She will likely do so once she feels that an appropriate amount of time has passed.~
@942  = ~The thought troubles me less than mayhap it should.~
@943  = ~Athkatlan politics at its very finest.~
@944  = ~That isn't very impartial of you.~
@945  = ~She'd do that? She seemed pretty decent for an Amnian noble.~
@946  = ~You have to obey the law. That doesn't mean you have to enjoy it.~
@947  = ~Aye, I know, though Lady Lamia genuinely wants whatever is best for Rana. For the moment, however, that may well be time spent in prison. Some of what has passed troubles me. Greatly.~
@948  = ~She is my sister, <CHARNAME>. I want what is best for her, though for now, that may well be time spent in prison. Some of what has passed troubles me. Greatly.~
@949  = ~Lady Lamia is a good person, <CHARNAME>, her rank notwithstanding. But she is also a powerful one, and she wants whatever is best for Rana.~
@950  = ~For the moment, however, that may well be time spent in prison. Some of what has passed troubles me. Greatly.~
@951  = ~There is very little about this that I do enjoy. I want whatever is best for Rana, however, and for now that may well be time spent in prison. Some of what has passed troubles me. Greatly.~
@952  = ~Alim al-Makram claims now that he framed Quentin of his own accord, but... I am not entirely convinced that Rana was uninvolved. The evidence pointed too conveniently at her husband. Such things seldom happen by accident.~
@953  = ~The smuggling I could bear, but deliberate treachery... I would not have thought her capable of it.~
@954  = ~People can do terrible things when they're under pressure.~
@955  = ~You don't know for certain that it was treachery.~
@956  = ~You also hadn't spoken to her in years. Athkatla can be corrupting.~
@957  = ~Were she and that smuggler lovers? He seemed interested enough.~
@958  = ~I cannot deny that.~
@959  = ~No, I don't, and I am not sure that she will ever tell me.~
@960  = ~Given his ill-will towards her husband... no, I do not think so.~
@961  = ~Whatever the truth may be, Quentin never disputed Alim's version of events after being released. I had assumed that he would force the issue, that he would wish to see Rana punished, but in the end...~
@962  = ~In the end, I think he truly loved her. More than she loved him.~
@963  = ~Do you still disapprove of him anyway?~
@964  = ~I can't imagine how he still could.~
@965  = ~He may still have been framed. You didn't force the issue yourself?~
@966  = ~If you can find anything positive in the mess, I won't fault you for that.~
@967  = ~I do not like him. I doubt I ever will, but disapproval... he deserves better than that.~
@968  = ~Love can be a strange thing at times.~
@969  = ~To what end? I understand your faith's emphasis upon truth, but here... sometimes I wonder if truth and facts are always the same thing.~
@970  = ~To what end? I am honor-bound to uphold truth and justice, aye, but here... sometimes I wonder if truth and facts are always the same thing.~
@971  = ~You misunderstand me, <CHARNAME>. This is not a matter of consolation. Not entirely, at least.~
@972  = ~I have questioned whether I should have pursued my suspicions, if I was blinded by affection for my sister, but I am not so certain. Even if she did betray him, 'twas his decision to forgive her.~
@973  = ~To deny him the right to make such a gesture, to disdain the love that drove him to that choice... there was more truth that day in silence than in speaking out.~
@974  = ~Would you have believed that if she wasn't your sister?~
@975  = ~I am not sure that I agree, but I don't have all the facts.~
@976  = ~That's the most convoluted justification for mercy I've ever heard.~
@977  = ~You are allowed to not want to see her suffer more than necessary, you know.~
@978  = ~There is never truth in silence. Howsoever you word it, it remains a failure of justice.~
@979  = ~I would like to think so, though I could not say for certain. I have never spent much time in the courts.~
@980  = ~Would that I could say that I did.~
@981  = ~Aye, perhaps that is all there is to it.~
@982  = ~And who determines what is necessary? Certainly not myself.~
@983  = ~I will not argue the point, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. On this matter, I fear that we would only speak past each other.~
@984  = ~But come, <CHARNAME>, we have spoken more than enough on this topic. Enough to weary me, at least.~
@985  = ~We see so much death these days, I wish--~ [rh#is132]
@986  = ~What I wish doesn't matter. Still, 'tis an understatement to say that it can grow wearying.~
@987  = ~"Wearying" is one way to put it. "Terrifying" and "appalling" would be others.~
@988  = ~We don't have much of an alternative, I'm afraid.~
@989  = ~Aren't you trained for this sort of thing?~
@990  = ~I don't have time for this right now, Isra.~
@991  = ~And a handful of other adjectives, I am sure.~
@992  = ~No, we do not.~
@993  = ~Aye, as much as anyone can be. That does not mean that I like it.~
@994  = ~Then I shall not trouble you with it.~
@995  = ~I accept the necessity of it, of course. That much I have always done, but sometimes... I suppose sometimes I cannot help but wonder why.~
@996  = ~Why people do stupid things. Why they do terrible things.~
@997  = ~The age-old question of evil, is it?~
@998  = ~There is a little thing called free will, you know.~
@999  = ~That can be a dangerous question to look at too closely.~
@1000 = ~Generally, they do it because they can get away with it.~
@1001 = ~I once had a... friend... within the Church of Tyr who used to say that it took a lifetime of deeds to save a man, but just one to damn him.~
@1002 = ~We argued over almost everything else, but that... I never challenged his cynicism there. Sometimes I wish I had.~
@1003 = ~He did have a point. Falling is easy; redemption is harder.~
@1004 = ~I would have. That's an extremely judgmental sentiment.~
@1005 = ~I take it you used to agree with him on the issue?~
@1006 = ~A friend? You don't sound so certain.~
@1007 = ~'Tis far more dangerous when overlooked, I think.~
@1008 = ~I think it would have to be, to be truly worthwhile.~
@1009 = ~I am not so sure. I might consider it overly simplistic, however. Indiscriminate.~
@1010 = ~I did not disagree, at least. Not then.~
@1011 = ~... A lover, <CHARNAME>. And one I've no wish to speak of. Especially not now.~
@1012 = ~My sister-- it should not surprise you that I have been thinking about her again. She is a Sunite also, you know. At least, she once was.~
@1013 = ~Smuggling is of little consequence to our faith, but the rest, the way she treated Quentin throughout it... that is more serious by far.~
@1014 = ~Not serious enough to get her kicked out of paradise, I hope?~
@1015 = ~She still has time to fix things, at least.~
@1016 = ~Isra, your sister may have made some stupid mistakes, but she's hardly a monster.~
@1017 = ~This sounds like a conversation you should be having with her instead.~
@1018 = ~I... couldn't say. Not for certain.~
@1019 = ~She does... assuming that she even wants to.~
@1020 = ~No, but if she doesn't correct those mistakes... I couldn't say.~
@1021 = ~I know. I would like to, but I don't think that feasible.~
@1022 = ~She was so angry when I last saw her. Anger like that... if she can't let go of it, I don't know what it will do to her. And I don't know how to help. I don't know if she would even let me.~
@1023 = ~Give it time. She'll come around eventually.~
@1024 = ~Don't complain to me about siblings. At least yours haven't tried to conquer the Sword Coast yet.~
@1025 = ~Maybe you should have considered that before turning her in.~
@1026 = ~You can't expect to solve her problems for her. Especially one like this.~
@1027 = ~I can only hope that is true.~
@1028 = ~Ah... yes. You do know how to put things into perspective.~
@1029 = ~I did. She received enough mercy as it was. More... I cannot imagine that it would have ended better.~
@1030 = ~I don't like feeling so helpless, but you may have the right of it.~
@1031 = ~(sigh) You are kind to listen to me, <CHARNAME>. Exceedingly so. I want you to know that I appreciate it.~
@1032 = ~You have my ear whenever you want it, Isra.~
@1033 = ~It's nothing that you wouldn't do for me.~
@1034 = ~This matter hasn't been easy for you. I understand that.~
@1035 = ~I would do far more than merely listen, you know.~
@1036 = ~I know. Thank you all the same.~
@1037 = ~I suppose not. Thank you all the same.~
@1038 = ~(smile) Thank you all the same, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.~
@1039 = ~Would you walk with me a while, <CHARNAME>? I would speak with you for a moment.~ [rh#is133]
@1040 = ~Are you thinking about your sister again?~
@1041 = ~Only for a moment, my lady?~
@1042 = ~You should know by now that you can always have my ear.~
@1043 = ~No. For once... for once, I am thinking of you instead.~
@1044 = ~(smile) For as long as you would like.~
@1045 = ~(smile) Aye, though sometimes I fear that I am abusing that privilege.~
@1046 = ~Of course. Then... later, I suppose.~
@1047 = ~You have been very good to me, my <PRO_LADYLORD>... my love. I wanted you to know that. I would be the first to admit that have not been as attentive as I could be as of late.~
@1048 = ~This recent madness with Rana... I hope that I haven't neglected you too much.~
@1049 = ~You've had a lot on your mind. I understand that.~
@1050 = ~You're quite welcome to make it up to me tonight.~
@1051 = ~You don't need to see to my needs all of the time, Isra.~
@1052 = ~And if you have?~
@1053 = ~Thank you. That is good to hear, though I should like to make it up to you regardless.~
@1054 = ~And I am sure that I will, though I had something more immediate in mind.~
@1055 = ~I should like to regardless.~
@1056 = ~If I have, then I should like to make it up to you.~
@1057 = ~Several of Athkatla's most skilled seamstresses are affiliated with the Church of Sune, and one of them in particular... I am pleased to say that I was able to find her mayhap a tenday ago.~
@1058 = ~'Tis no great secret that I would wish to see you bedecked in silks one day, my <PRO_LADYLORD>, but for now, this will have to suffice.~
@1059 = ~Oh, Isra. That is the most exquisite cloak I've ever seen.~
@1060 = ~Aren't you afraid that I'll ruin something like this?~
@1061 = ~Dare I even ask how much this thing cost you?~
@1062 = ~I take it I'm not an appropriate consort for you when dressed in rags.~
@1063 = ~'Tis one of her best works, I would have to agree.~
@1064 = ~The enchantments should keep it clean and intact for some time.~
@1065 = ~I would certainly rather you did not.~
@1066 = ~Do not say such things, <CHARNAME>. They are not true.~
@1067 = ~But come, I should like to see how this looks on you right now. If you could stand still for one moment, I think-- hmm.~
@1068 = ~Magnificent, my <PRO_LADYLORD>... though I had expected no less. I had hoped that it would prove a fetching color for you, and I seem to have judged well. Very well indeed.~
@1069 = ~Thank you, Isra. Sincerely. It's beautiful.~
@1070 = ~It's red. Like everything else you own. You do realize other colors exist, I hope.~
@1071 = ~Keep eyeing me like that, and you'll be seeing me out of it again... and everything else.~
@1072 = ~I'm still somewhat worried about ruining it on the road.~
@1073 = ~(smile) Aye, it is... but no more so than you are yourself.~
@1074 = ~(laugh) I do, aye, though none of them are quite so grand.~
@1075 = ~(laugh) Will I? Hopefully not in public.~
@1076 = ~(smile) If you would rather not risk it, I shan't complain, though I do not believe that you need to worry about that.~
@1077 = ~Walk with me a moment longer, my love... I do not wish to strain my neck turning to look at you, and I am sure I shall be doing that for quite some time.~
@1078 = ~Would you walk with me a while, my <PRO_LADYLORD>? I would speak with you for a moment.~ [rh#is133]
@1079 = ~You can always have my ear, Isra.~
@1080 = ~No. For once... for once, I am not.~
@1081 = ~You have been very good to me. Your kindness as of late... I am exceedingly glad that I met you, <CHARNAME>. I have known many good people throughout my life, but you...~
@1082 = ~I do not think that you realize how singular you are.~
@1083 = ~From you, Isra, that's high praise indeed.~
@1084 = ~You must be exaggerating, surely.~
@1085 = ~Not quite as much so as you are, I suspect.~
@1086 = ~You're welcome to tell me. In as much detail as you'd like.~
@1087 = ~'Tis no more than what you have earned, though... hopefully my next words will not seem overly forward.~
@1088 = ~I should hope not. My next words... hopefully they wll not seem overly forward.~
@1089 = ~You flatter me, though my next words... hopefully they will not seem overly forward.~
@1090 = ~Am I? Then I trust that may next words will not seem overly forward.~
@1091 = ~I... hope that you will forgive me for taking the liberty of commissioning something on your behalf, <PRO_LADYLORD>. 'Twas too perfect an opportunity.~
@1092 = ~I wish I had something to give you in return, Isra.~
@1093 = ~Your company is more than enough, I assure you.~
@1094 = ~Magnificent, my <PRO_LADYLORD>... more so even than I had expected. I... I had hoped that the color would prove fetching... by Sune, does it ever.~
@1095 = ~I think I like the sight of you tongue-tied even better, Isra.~
@1096 = ~Says the stunningly gorgeous Sunite.~
@1097 = ~Isra... I'm not comfortable with the way you're looking at me.~
@1098 = ~(smile) I do, aye, though none of them are quite so grand. And grandness... it becomes you.~
@1099 = ~(laugh) I shall try not to make a habit of it, though... I can promise little.~
@1100 = ~(laugh) Then you should trust my judgment.~
@1101 = ~Oh. I see. I... forgive me if I caused any offense.~
@1102 = ~I... I am sorry, <CHARNAME>. I do not mean to stare so. I... mayhap 'twould be better to simply move on now.~
@1103 = ~It cannot be too much longer until we get to the bottom of this. Do you mean to remain in Amn afterward?~ [rh#is134]
@1104 = ~I would like to. I've enjoyed the country so far.~
@1105 = ~Not if I have any say in the matter. I hate Athkatla.~
@1106 = ~Who says I'll have a choice? I've never had one before.~
@1107 = ~I am glad to hear it. I've no wish to see you leave.~
@1108 = ~That is unfortunate. Forgive my selfishness, but I've no wish to see you leave.~
@1109 = ~We can still hope for the best, then. Forgive my selfishness, but I've no wish to see you leave.~
@1110 = ~Of course, if that is what you would prefer.~
@1111 = ~People such as you, <CHARNAME>... there are not enough of them here as it is. One more or less may seem of little consequence, but I think the evidence would suggest otherwise.~
@1112 = ~I didn't ask you for a sermon, Isra.~
@1113 = ~What exactly are you getting at?~
@1114 = ~Is that really the only reason you'd want to keep me around?~
@1115 = ~One person can make all the difference in the world, is it?~
@1116 = ~I did not realize I was giving one. I was just thinking aloud, I suppose.~
@1117 = ~I am just thinking aloud, I suppose.~
@1118 = ~No, it isn't. I should think that rather obvious by now also.~
@1119 = ~For good or for ill, aye. One person usually does.~
@1120 = ~I have been considering the future as of late. I don't do that terribly often, but you... I have enjoyed working with you, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.~
@1121 = ~I would miss it, should circumstances push us apart.~
@1122 = ~I've enjoyed your company as well.~
@1123 = ~I suspect they will sooner or later.~
@1124 = ~Are you planning on leaving?~
@1125 = ~Whatever. Could we please move on now?~
@1126 = ~Then that is something.~
@1127 = ~So do I, truth be told. I am always hesitant to make predictions.~
@1128 = ~Not yet, certainly. I intend to see this through until the end, but after that... I'm hesitant to make predictions.~
@1129 = ~As you wish.~
@1130 = ~(sigh) This is a poor time to be looking so far into the future, of course. Imoen... every day we wait is a day we lose. I am growing worried about what we might discover when we find her.~
@1131 = ~So am I, I assure you.~
@1132 = ~We're moving as quickly as we can.~
@1133 = ~After a day with her in the party? A headache, more likely than not.~
@1134 = ~I can believe it.~
@1135 = ~I know. Hopefully it will be quickly enough.~
@1136 = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>. She is not quite as bad as that.~
@1137 = ~If she is as much of one as my sister Alia, I shall be very impressed indeed.~
@1138 = ~I am almost glad there is so little entertainment this evening, <CHARNAME>. For once, I would simply rather think. And talk, mayhap.~ [rh#is135]
@1139 = ~With me, I hope.~
@1140 = ~What was on your mind?~
@1141 = ~You're not usually quite so withdrawn.~
@1142 = ~I was about to head to bed, actually.~
@1143 = ~(smile) Aye, with you.~
@1144 = ~(smile) You, oddly enough.~
@1145 = ~(smile) I have my quiet moments as well, few though they may be. And tonight...~
@1146 = ~Oh. Very well, then. Good night.~
@1147 = ~How often do you find yourself contemplating the past, my <PRO_LADYLORD>? Candlekeep, the struggle in Baldur's Keep...~
@1148 = ~I live in the present as much as I can, but sometimes I wonder if I am not more inclined towards nostalgia than most people.~
@1149 = ~I don't think about Candlekeep very often at all.~
@1150 = ~When the present is so troubled, a bit of nostalgia can be expected.~
@1151 = ~You do generally seem more interested in the past than the future.~
@1152 = ~I hold my memories of Candlekeep very dear to me.~
@1153 = ~Then I may well think about it more than you do.~
@1154 = ~That may well be part of it. And the past has always held a certain fascination for me regardless... my own, those of the people around me.~
@1155 = ~I know. It has always held a certain fascination for me... my own, those of the people around me.~
@1156 = ~That is good, I think. And mayhap reassuring.~
@1157 = ~I have been trying to picture you as a child, <CHARNAME>, though 'tis somewhat more difficult than I might have expected.~
@1158 = ~Perhaps that should not surprise me. A <PRO_MANWOMAN> such as you... the demands of this life have likely washed away whatever you might have been before.~
@1159 = ~Actually, I was always very much like I am now.~
@1160 = ~I never had much of a childhood. There was no time for it.~
@1161 = ~I was very much like any child, I think. Except a bit lonelier.~
@1162 = ~I was completely uncontrollable. You should hear the stories.~
@1163 = ~Were you? Mayhap that explains why I cannot imagine you any other way.~
@1164 = ~Aye, some of us get forced into adulthood before we are ready for it.~
@1165 = ~In a home like Candlekeep... I can believe that.~
@1166 = ~Were you, truly? You are very nearly a force of nature now, so mayhap that is to be expected.~
@1167 = ~It always astounds me, the unexpected ways in which people can grow and change over time. Myself... you would probably not have recognized me half a decade ago.~
@1168 = ~You would certainly not have recognized me further back than that, but even in Crimmor, in the midst of my training... (laugh) I was a somber young thing, I'm afraid. I took the littlest of things utterly seriously.~
@1169 = ~I can't see you not knowing how to smile, Isra.~
@1170 = ~You didn't know how to take a joke, did you?~
@1171 = ~Obviously something must have happened to change that.~
@1172 = ~You still can get pretty unbearably formal at times.~
@1173 = ~Oh, I could smile. I was never entirely grim, but being able to laugh at myself... that had to be learned.~
@1174 = ~Not one directed at myself, certainly. That had to be learned.~
@1175 = ~Something did. Or someone, rather.~
@1176 = ~Oh, I know, but I no longer care when someone laughs at me because of it. I have become far too accustomed to such things.~
@1177 = ~There was a woman in Crimmor, a priestess of Lliira... sometimes I think that combating solemnity must be one of Lliira's charges to her followers. If so, Mairen was very attentive to that duty. And very successful in the end.~
@1178 = ~I trust that it will not surprise you to learn that I loved her for a time, <CHARNAME>. Much like I love you now. Before her... my romances left something to be desired, I'm afraid.~
@1179 = ~I loved her for a time, <CHARNAME>. Much like I love you now. Before her... my romances left something to be desired, I'm afraid.~
@1180 = ~Mia and I... you would like her, I think. And not simply because you are both Lliirans.~
@1181 = ~Mia and I... you would like her, I think. Most people do, truth be told.~
@1182 = ~If we ever have a chance to visit Crimmor, I shall need to introduce the two of you. She is engaged now, but I am sure she would appreciate meeting you regardless.~
@1183 = ~You're not... exclusively interested in women, I hope?~
@1184 = ~You sound like you're still fond of her.~
@1185 = ~I think I would appreciate that as well.~
@1186 = ~An irreverent former lover? Imagine all the stories I could learn.~
@1187 = ~She's engaged? I pity the lover who has to come after you.~
@1188 = ~I'm not sure how keen I'd be on meeting one of your former lovers, Isra.~
@1189 = ~(laugh) Not at all, my Lord, I can assure you of that much.~
@1190 = ~I am. I expect that I shall always be, though we have both moved on by now.~
@1191 = ~(smile) Then I shall have to keep it in mind.~
@1192 = ~(laugh) Aye, and Mia would be all too happy to share them, I am sure.~
@1193 = ~(laugh) You flatter me, but as far as I can tell, they are well matched. Better by far than she and I were.~
@1194 = ~If you think it would be awkward, I certainly shan't insist upon it, but I assure you, she and I have both moved on by now.~
@1195 = ~I shall need to tell you more about her later, I think. I do not normally like to discuss former lovers, but you have the right to know about such things.~
@1196 = ~For now, however... the evening is still lovely, and I would hate to waste the entirety of it discussing the past.~
@1197 = ~With the future so uncertain, the past seems a better topic than most.~
@1198 = ~As would I. I'm sure we can think of more pleasant things to talk about.~
@1199 = ~If there were music playing tonight, I would ask you to dance.~
@1200 = ~Perhaps we should retire someplace a little more... private.~
@1201 = ~Perhaps I shall tell you more about her later. I do not normally like to discuss former lovers, but you... I trust you more than enough with such things.~
@1202 = ~For now, however... the evening is still lovely. I would hate to waste the entirety of it discussing the past.~
@1203 = ~As would I. Especially when the future is so much more interesting.~
@1204 = ~Would you consider retiring someplace a little more... private?~
@1205 = ~Aye, I cannot deny that much.~
@1206 = ~I am certain that we can as well, my love.~
@1207 = ~And I would be more than inclined to accept, <CHARNAME>. Perhaps the opportunity will present itself another evening.~
@1208 = ~Later, my love. I think that I would prefer to simply rest with you here for a time.~
@1209 = ~Hmm... mayhap we should discuss that, then.~
@1210 = ~Hmm. You are a handsome man, <CHARNAME>, in more ways than one, but... I must decline. At least for the moment.~
@1211 = ~Hmm. You are a beautiful woman, <CHARNAME>, in more ways than one, but... I must decline. At least for the moment.~
@1212 = ~Our conversation from the other night, <CHARNAME>... mayhap I should not be surprised to find myself thinking of it again. Sometimes I am fonder of introspection than I should be.~ [rh#is136]
@1213 = ~I would certainly be inclined to agree with that, my lady.~
@1214 = ~What part of it exactly have you been thinking about?~
@1215 = ~You did say you were going to tell me more about her.~
@1216 = ~Isra, I don't really want to hear about your ex. At all.~
@1217 = ~Aye, I cannot help but focus upon every little mistake I might have made... even if those mistakes are several years old now.~
@1218 = ~All of the small mistakes that I might have made, unfortunately.~
@1219 = ~I did, aye. Perhaps I should fulfill that promise now, though... all I can think of at the moment are the small mistakes I might have made.~
@1220 = ~Oh. I see. Forgive me, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.~
@1221 = ~I do not want you to think that I am unhappy with the way things have played out, because I am not, but... I have been a fool in the past, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. I do not want to be a fool with you as well.~
@1222 = ~'Tis a strange thing to share with you, mayhap, but... I have become very comfortable with you, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. Even concerning matters such as this.~
@1223 = ~Mairen and I... sometimes I am astounded that we managed to save our friendship at all. I have not always been so fortunate in the past, and I was still quite young. At least in the ways that mattered.~
@1224 = ~I did not yet realize exactly what my calling entailed. The difficulties that this lifestyle comes with... I was still romanticizing them, I think. I believed I could have everything that I might wish for.~
@1225 = ~Mia didn't think that, of course, and I should have known better myself. That is easy enough to accept after the fact.~
@1226 = ~Don't sell yourself too short, Isra.~
@1227 = ~What exactly happened between you two?~
@1228 = ~I'm not sure I really want to hear the full story.~
@1229 = ~(smile) Your confidence in me is heartening, but in this matter...~
@1230 = ~(sigh) My life is... somewhat more complicated at times than I might wish at times.~
@1231 = ~This is a difficult path for any of us. It has to be. The fact that my goddess is gentler with us than most... that does little to moderate the challenges of it.~
@1232 = ~I was never around enough once I began campaigning, and even when I was... tourneys and training only prepare one so much. Actual battle, <CHARNAME>... it changes a person. I am sure you have noticed the same.~
@1233 = ~I tried to pretend that nothing had changed. The realities of battle... I did not want to subject her to the horror of it. 'Tis perhaps a nobler reason than some to shut a lover out of one's life, but the result is the same.~
@1234 = ~Silence and distrust. I can believe it.~
@1235 = ~At least you learn from your mistakes. Many don't bother.~
@1236 = ~Perhaps you were simply not meant to be with her.~
@1237 = ~She wasn't into adventuring herself?~
@1238 = ~Don't ever shut me out like that, Isra. Please.~
@1239 = ~Aye, though more of the former than the latter, thank Sune.~
@1240 = ~That is true enough.~
@1241 = ~(smile) Perhaps not.~
@1242 = ~(smile) Clearly I was not.~
@1243 = ~No, she was not. 'Twas one of our many differences.~
@1244 = ~I don't intend to. I can assure you of that much.~
@1245 = ~I... don't think I ever expected to find something like that again, you know. Though I cannot say that I have truly tried that hard.~
@1246 = ~Perhaps that was not very pious of me, but at moments like this... I'm not altogether certain that I regret it.~
@1247 = ~You should smile at me like that more often, Isra.~
@1248 = ~If it means you're eligible, I can't say I regret it either.~
@1249 = ~Do you think that perhaps you and I...?~
@1250 = ~Isra, you do know that I'm not interested in women, right?~
@1251 = ~Isra, I don't want to give you the wrong idea about anything.~
@1252 = ~(laugh) I smile at you often enough, I should think.~
@1253 = ~(laugh) Oh, <CHARNAME>. Such bluntness becomes you, I think.~
@1254 = ~I think... I think that is something that remains to be seen.~
@1255 = ~Oh. Oh, of course not. Forgive me if I overstepped myself, <CHARNAME>.~
@1256 = ~I... don't think I ever expected to find something like that again, you know. And truly, perhaps I have not. You and she, <CHARNAME>... you are like night and day, and not simply because you are a man instead.~
@1257 = ~I... don't think I ever expected to find something like that again, you know. And truly, perhaps I have not. You and she, <CHARNAME>... you are like night and day. I have never known two women to be so utterly different.~
@1258 = ~Mia does not have your venturesome spirit. I mean that as no slight to her; she also doesn't have your legion of enemies, but you and I...~
@1259 = ~'Tis by far a better match. I think she would agree.~
@1260 = ~Yes, there's no need to worry about tranquility with me around.~
@1261 = ~As long as you have no regrets.~
@1262 = ~We do have equally complicated lives, I suppose.~
@1263 = ~You don't need to try to spare my feelings, Isra.~
@1264 = ~Oh, we have our moments of that as well.~
@1265 = ~I regret many things, but not the fact that it ended.~
@1266 = ~Yours is likely more so than my own... which is something of a novelty itself.~
@1267 = ~'Tis the simple truth. Nothing more and nothing less.~
@1268 = ~(smile) Would you give me your hand, my love? We have tarried long enough now, another moment would make litle difference.~
@1269 = ~In exchange for a kiss, my lady?~
@1270 = ~I would give you far more than a hand, Isra.~
@1271 = ~Moments have a way of multiplying, you know.~
@1272 = ~A moment may make all of the difference in the world.~
@1273 = ~A bargain as favorable as that... no Amnian lady could ever refuse it.~
@1274 = ~Oh, I can certainly believe that, though at the moment, I dare say a hand would suffice.~
@1275 = ~Aye, so they do. Shall we move on, then?~
@1276 = ~Aye, so it might. I think I am willing to chance that, however.~
@1277 = ~You look thoughtful to<DAYNIGHT>, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. It suits you.~ [rh#is137]
@1278 = ~I have a lot on my mind these days.~
@1279 = ~Does it, now? I'm glad to hear that you approve.~
@1280 = ~That's good, at least. Nothing else about this suits me.~
@1281 = ~That's awfully nonchalant of you.~
@1282 = ~Can't this wait until later, Isra?~
@1283 = ~I know. I would be more worried if you did not.~
@1284 = ~When it comes to you, <CHARNAME>, I almost always do.~
@1285 = ~I'm sorry to hear you say that.~
@1286 = ~'Twas a compliment, <CHARNAME>. Nothing more.~
@1287 = ~If you wish it, aye.~
@1288 = ~I know this is not the easiest of situations. This is not the easiest of lives in general, and with Imoen still missing--~
@1289 = ~Sometimes I worry for you.~
@1290 = ~I'm doing just fine, I assure you.~
@1291 = ~Is it really that obvious that I'm in over my head?~
@1292 = ~I'm not about to fall apart. I can't exactly afford to.~
@1293 = ~What's there to worry about?~
@1294 = ~I sleep lightly, <CHARNAME>. I haven't said anything, but I have noticed that you sometimes have difficulty sleeping at all.~
@1295 = ~We may be very busy, but if you need to take an evening to yourself every so often, 'twould hardly be inappropriate.~
@1296 = ~You know as well as I do that we haven't the time for that.~
@1297 = ~An evening of debauchery may be just the boost I need.~
@1298 = ~We seem to be taking more than enough evenings as it is.~
@1299 = ~I'm not sure how that would help anything.~
@1300 = ~I doubt an evening would make much of a dent. A whole tenday, however...~
@1301 = ~I know that every person has their limits. Even you.~
@1302 = ~(laugh) I cannot say that is exactly what I had in mind.~
@1303 = ~And don't think me too greedy for more. I just... I hate to watch you struggle so.~
@1304 = ~An evening may make more of a difference than you realize.~
@1305 = ~We have a saying within the Ruby Rose... if a person cannot take the time to care for <PRO_HIMHER>self, <PRO_HESHE> should not be trusted to take care of anybody else either.~
@1306 = ~I do not mean to preach, but I know how difficult it can be to remember when matters get serious.~
@1307 = ~You don't seem to have any trouble with it.~
@1308 = ~That isn't a problem. I'm not as selfless as you think I am.~
@1309 = ~Thank you. I do appreciate the reminder from time to time.~
@1310 = ~So even Sunite paladins make excuses for narcissism.~
@1311 = ~You don't mean to preach? It just happens by accident, then?~
@1312 = ~I have had time to learn. More than you have, mayhap.~
@1313 = ~Nor exactly selfish either.~
@1314 = ~I thought you might.~
@1315 = ~Is anything other than utter self-sacrifice suddenly narcissism? If you truly think that... well, you would do well to employ a bit more courtesy in the future.~
@1316 = ~Sometimes, aye.~
@1317 = ~I do trust you, <CHARNAME>. More than I could say. With yourself, with this quest, with me...~
@1318 = ~(smile) Especially with me.~
@1319 = ~And I do appreciate the thought. More than I can say.~
@1320 = ~I think I might like a demonstration of that later tonight.~
@1321 = ~I'd like to kiss you right now, Isra.~
@1322 = ~We'd have a bit of a problem if you didn't, wouldn't we?~
@1323 = ~Walk with me awhile, would you? This moment is too pleasant to simply cut short.~
@1324 = ~Would you, now? Perhaps something along those lines can be arranged.~
@1325 = ~I should like that as well... would that we had more than mere moments to spare for it.~
@1326 = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>... I suppose that is true enough, though I do wish you would at least try to indulge my romantic flights a bit.~
@1327 = ~Perhaps I shouldn't pry so, but I won't pretend that I haven't come to care about you, <CHARNAME>. A great deal.~
@1328 = ~As a companion, but also... also as something more, I think.~
@1329 = ~The sentiment is certainly shared, Isra.~
@1330 = ~Do you think that maybe you and I...?~
@1331 = ~You've been hinting as much for some time now.~
@1332 = ~Please, stop. I really don't want to hear what comes next.~
@1333 = ~I had hoped as much, though... well. 'Twas impossible to be certain.~
@1334 = ~I think I would like that. I would like that very much.~
@1335 = ~I have never been terribly secretive about such things, though... well. I've learned to be a bit quieter.~
@1336 = ~Oh. I see. Very well, then.~
@1337 = ~I must be fully honest with you. There are certain things I cannot offer you. Marriage, family... some consider such prospects compatible with a paladin's calling, but I don't. I have seen the toll that this lifestyle can take on a lover... I would not wish bind someone to me with vows as well.~
@1338 = ~I must be fully honest with you. There are certain things I cannot offer you. Marriage, family... well, unless we were to do something quite unconventional, children are unlikely anyway, and perhaps that's for the best.~
@1339 = ~Don't speak in absolutes. People do change their minds.~
@1340 = ~And I might as well, should I survive another decade or so. In the meantime, however, all we have to work with is the present.~
@1341 = ~I understand, <CHARNAME>. Really, I do. I can only pray that you find what you are looking for.~
@1342 = ~Well, I can't say I ever really liked children anyway.~
@1343 = ~Perhaps this conversation should have waited until the evening instead. This is no time to get distracted, and you... I don't think you realize exactly how distracting you are right now, <CHARNAME>.~
@1344 = ~We can spare the time at least for a kiss, I think.~
@1345 = ~Oh, I think I have an idea. Come over here, would you?~
@1346 = ~I... um, could we please take things a bit more slowly?~
@1347 = ~Not quite distracting enough, apparently.~
@1348 = ~That much I can certainly manage, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. Gladly.~
@1349 = ~Of course. I had no intention of making you uncomfortable, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. Shall we simply continue on for now?~
@1350 = ~(laugh) If you mean to test my discipline, my <PRO_LADYLORD>... well, 'tis a pleasanter trial than most.~
@1351 = ~I-- by the gods, <CHARNAME>, I'm sorry. I... didn't realize that you were still bathing.~ [rh#is138]
@1352 = ~I... I can come back later. If you would prefer it, that is.~
@1353 = ~It's alright. I was done anyway. Could you pass me that towel?~
@1354 = ~I didn't think that Sunites were quite so bashful.~
@1355 = ~Why so bashful? It's nothing you haven't seen before.~
@1356 = ~No need for that. Now that you're here, you might as well join me.~
@1357 = ~Um, yes. Yes, I would. Knocking, Isra. It can't be that hard a concept.~
@1358 = ~Of course. I would be more than happy to. Here it is, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.~
@1359 = ~Not about our own bodies, certainly, though I imagine it would be odd for chivalry to only run one way.~
@1360 = ~Here, allow me to get you a towel to wrap around your waist, at least.~
@1361 = ~'Tis a matter of chivalry, not faith. To walk upon a woman in such a state... were I a man, I imagine I would be too mortified to speak with you for a tenday.~
@1362 = ~Luckily I am not. Here, allow me to get you a towel, at least.~
@1363 = ~'Tis a matter of chivalry, my love. To be so careless... well, I suppose I would have laughed it off easily enough had our positions been reversed.~
@1364 = ~'Tis a matter of chivalry, my love. To be so careless... were I a man, I imagine I would be too mortified to speak with you for a tenday.~
@1365 = ~As tempting as your offer is, I'm afraid I prefer cleaner water. Here, let me get you a towel to wrap around your waist, at least.~
@1366 = ~As tempting as your offer is, I'm afraid I prefer cleaner water. Here, let me get you a towel to wrap around yourself, at least.~
@1367 = ~I... yes. Yes, of course. I'm sorry.~
@1368 = ~(laugh) I seem to have forgotten what I came here to say in the first place, though that isn't terribly surprising. You cut a fine enough figure when fully dressed. Like this... hmm. Perhaps I should get you a tunic as well.~
@1369 = ~I would appreciate it.~
@1370 = ~You're just looking for excuses to touch me now, aren't you?~
@1371 = ~I'd be happier helping you out of your own clothing, you know.~
@1372 = ~Isra, I don't need the help. This is awkward enough as it is.~
@1373 = ~(laugh) I seem to have forgotten what I came here to say in the first place, though that isn't terribly surprising. Perhaps... hmm. I might as well help you with those laces while I'm here.~
@1374 = ~I had hoped you would. I--~
@1375 = ~I cannot say that isn't one of my motives, but--~
@1376 = ~Would you, now? Perhaps in a little while, but for the moment--~
@1377 = ~Oh. This scar, <CHARNAME>... is it new? I'm quite certain I've never seen it before.~
@1378 = ~I didn't think your touch could heal scarring.~
@1379 = ~Scar!? What scar?~
@1380 = ~I've picked up so many by now, it's hard to remember.~
@1381 = ~It's funny what well placed clothing can hide.~
@1382 = ~No, it can't, though there are salves that can fade it further, if you wish it, but... you do wear it well enough.~
@1383 = ~On your shoulder. It isn't that terrible, I assure you. You wear it quite well, actually.~
@1384 = ~I've never found permanent scarring easy to forget, though this one... you do wear it well enough.~
@1385 = ~Oh, I am as skilled at that as anyone. This one, though... you do wear it well enough.~
@1386 = ~Were it your face, I might have felt inclined to heal it immediately, but here... mayhap there is something to be said for scarring as a cosmetic choice.~
@1387 = ~By the gods, Isra, have you lost your mind entirely?~
@1388 = ~I never guessed that you'd be the type to go for a man with scars.~
@1389 = ~I never would have guessed that you appreciated scars at all.~
@1390 = ~It wasn't exactly a choice, Isra.~
@1391 = ~If every scar gets me this sort of attention, I might be inclined to collect more.~
@1392 = ~I'm sorry. I shouldn't be quite so lighthearted, but... I find it odd, sometimes.~
@1393 = ~I usually don't, though... I find it odd, sometimes.~
@1394 = ~No, you're right. Perhaps I shouldn't be quite so lighthearted about it, but... I find it odd, sometimes.~
@1395 = ~Oh, I wouldn't go quite that far, though... I find it odd, sometimes.~
@1396 = ~'Tis no great secret that Sunites are... unenthusiastic about blemishes and scars. Whether they actually detract from beauty, though... everything in this world is flawed in some way or another. Perhaps that makes less of a difference than we think.~
@1397 = ~Or perhaps you've so beguiled me that these things no longer seem to matter at all.~
@1398 = ~Beguiling, am I? Not half so much as you are when you smile at me like that.~
@1399 = ~A simple scar or two shouldn't matter anyway.~
@1400 = ~If charm spells worked on you, I'd be sorely tempted sometimes.~
@1401 = ~Well, you know what they say about dashing young gentlemen.~
@1402 = ~Well, you know what they say about womanly charms.~
@1403 = ~So I needn't worry about you losing interest if I ever get scarred for real?~
@1404 = ~Beguiling? That isn't a word a half-orc hears very often.~
@1405 = ~Beguiling? That isn't a sentiment a <PRO_RACE> hears from a human very ofen.~
@1406 = ~Beguiling, am I? A halfling normally hears "adorable" instead.~
@1407 = ~And they don't. Not really. What matters is you and me, and--~
@1408 = ~Would you, my <PRO_LADYLORD>? Really, 'twould be a waste of a spell anyway. I--~
@1409 = ~Aye, indeed. Not quite as much as they should in your case, that is. I--~
@1410 = ~I do hope you're jesting now, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. There was never a danger of that, as I'm sure you know. I--~
@1411 = ~I did not mispeak, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. Not where matters of beauty are concerned. You--~
@1412 = ~(laugh) Oh, listen to us, <CHARNAME>... what an odd way this is to hold a conversation, with you half dressed, and me wearing... well, not a great deal more, truth be told.~
@1413 = ~Perhaps we ought to do something about that.~
@1414 = ~As much as I enjoy scanty Sunite fashion... yes, I might enjoy you out of it even more.~
@1415 = ~I should get dressed. I'd like to head back to the common room for a while longer.~
@1416 = ~Very subtle, Isra. You hardly need to seduce me, you know.~
@1417 = ~Are you asking-- of course you are. I'd love to spend the night with you.~
@1418 = ~I'm not in the mood for anything more than a good night's rest, I'm afraid.~
@1419 = ~Would you? I think that can be arranged.~
@1420 = ~Then I suppose I shall see you in the morn. Good night, <CHARNAME>.~
@1421 = ~I still enjoy it from time to time... but come, I mean to retire now. You are welcome to join me, of course.~
@1422 = ~I see. Well, I cannot fault you for that.~
@1423 = ~Sometimes I wish we had a temple of our own within Athkatla. The Heartwarders in Crimmor have been talking about establishing one for years, but somehow those plans always fall through.~ [rh#is139]
@1424 = ~That is strange. Isn't the Sunite faith prevalent here?~
@1425 = ~Do they really get distracted that easily?~
@1426 = ~You could always just move in with the Lathandrites.~
@1427 = ~The Athkatlan nobility is frivolous enough as it is.~
@1428 = ~I don't have the time for this right now, Isra.~
@1429 = ~Prevalent enough, aye.~
@1430 = ~They are enthusiastic people. And distractions are... all too common.~
@1431 = ~We... do. More often than you might think. But that is hardly the same.~
@1432 = ~That is not our doing. Sune does not encourage empty frivolity any more than Waukeen favors blind greed.~
@1433 = ~Several years ago, one of our high priestesses was in the process of getting government approval of the plans for a new temple. I am... not quite certain what happened.~
@1434 = ~We left for campaign at the beginning of Mirtul, right after the Greengrass festivities, and when we returned, the high priestess was gone. She had apparently run off with a merchant from Berdusk or Iriaebor or Priapurl. Nobody could decide exactly which city.~
@1435 = ~Much of the rest of the hierarchy had been inexplicably overturned as well, and by the time the new leadership managed to find the plans, the Athkatlan property that was being considered was no longer available.~
@1436 = ~That... happens more often than I would like, I'm afraid.~
@1437 = ~I assume the Ruby Rose has a better relationship with structure.~
@1438 = ~Temples are fairly unimportant in the greater scheme of things anyway.~
@1439 = ~How do they ever get anything done at all?~
@1440 = ~Tell me, which was worse? The disorganization itself or the fact that nobody else could understand why it bothered you afterwards?~
@1441 = ~To say the least. We're more casual about it than some orders, but not quite as casual as that.~
@1442 = ~I am not sure that I would agree.~
@1443 = ~I... truly, I couldn't answer that. I don't know.~
@1444 = ~The lack of understanding, I think.~
@1445 = ~I do not mind the disorganization. Not overly so, at least. One can grow accustomed to it over time, but other things...~
@1446 = ~Other things are harder to ignore. Especially in Athkatla. We could be doing more here, <CHARNAME>. I am not sure why we are not.~
@1447 = ~From the outside, it's hard to say what is and isn't being done.~
@1448 = ~What more would you expect of the church?~
@1449 = ~Probably because that would involve a lot of hard work.~
@1450 = ~This city is unsalvageable, no matter how organized the effort.~
@1451 = ~Not as difficult as that.~
@1452 = ~I would expect more conviction.~
@1453 = ~I... I wish I could find fault with your cynicism.~
@1454 = ~That may prove true, but... I do not care for the thought.~
@1455 = ~I am not certain that you realize exactly how popular the Firehair's faith is within this country, especially amongst the wealthy. Even in Athkatla, as unlikely as that might seem.~
@1456 = ~How a group of people who claim to worship love could be so blind to it, so callous and unconcerned... some churches wouldn't accept such behavior from their followers. We... well, clearly we do.~
@1457 = ~You would know more than I would if matters are better further north, but here in Amn... sometimes I think that they can hardly be any worse.~
@1458 = ~It may be that we worry that pushing too hard would drive our richest patrons out of the church, but I don't think that much of an excuse.~
@1459 = ~The Sunite church couldn't function if it didn't have any gold.~
@1460 = ~Not everyone can be expected to be devoutly religious.~
@1461 = ~Have you ever raised this concern with your clergy?~
@1462 = ~Have you ever raised this concern with the clergy?~
@1463 = ~Have you ever raised this concern with anyone else in the clergy?~
@1464 = ~You're actually jealous of the more orderly churches' discipline, aren't you?~
@1465 = ~You can't have it both ways, Isra. You can't suddenly expect discipline from a faith that largely rejects it.~
@1466 = ~The responsibility isn't entirely yours. The Lathandrites don't seem capable of doing that much with these people either.~
@1467 = ~The responsibility isn't entirely ours. The Lathandrites don't seem capable of doing that much with these people either.~
@1468 = ~Even so... I am sure we could challenge our patrons more than we do.~
@1469 = ~I do not ask for devoutness. Mere sincerity would suffice.~
@1470 = ~I haven't. Not yet, at least. It has been difficult enough to admit it even to myself.~
@1471 = ~Aside from yourself? No. Not yet, at least. It has been difficult enough to admit it even to myself.~
@1472 = ~I... I cannot really deny it. Sometimes I suppose I am.~
@1473 = ~I do not ask for that much, <CHARNAME>.~
@1474 = ~Then perhaps there is no hope whatsoever? That isn't exactly a comforting thought.~
@1475 = ~'Tis no secret at all what other faiths think of us. Vain, frivolous, flighty... the list goes on and on. Most of those criticisms are ignorant nonsense, but this one... I hate that it is actually true.~
@1476 = ~Nobody is perfect, Isra. At least, no mortal is.~
@1477 = ~There are worse criticisms that can be leveled against a church.~
@1478 = ~I didn't realize that those stereotypes bothered you.~
@1479 = ~I would never say any of those things about you.~
@1480 = ~It's hardly the only one that's true.~
@1481 = ~We can't be expected to work miracles. We do what we can.~
@1482 = ~That much I can't deny.~
@1483 = ~Perhaps, though that hardly serves as an excuse.~
@1484 = ~They bother me less than they once did, but... yes, they do. How could they not?~
@1485 = ~I didn't think that you would, but I'm glad to hear it regardless.~
@1486 = ~I... see. I hadn't realized that you felt that way. Forgive me if I refrain from discussing such things with you again.~
@1487 = ~I know, <CHARNAME>. At least, I would like to believe as much.~
@1488 = ~I am not sure that it is fair of me to trouble you with this type of question. 'Tis to the high priestesses in Crimmor that I should be complaining instead, but... thank you, <CHARNAME>.~
@1489 = ~I could not say how long I have been pretending that I did not feel like this. To finally admit it... 'tis something of a relief.~
@1490 = ~You're welcome, Isra.~
@1491 = ~Thank you for trusting me enough to share it.~
@1492 = ~I can imagine that it would be.~
@1493 = ~That's part of what I'm here for.~
@1494 = ~I take it you don't want me telling this to everyone we meet.~
@1495 = ~(smile) You are a very patient <PRO_MANWOMAN>, <CHARNAME>. That is rarer than you may realize.~
@1496 = ~(smile) To say the least, aye.~
@1497 = ~Ah... no. No, I would appreciate it if you did not.~
@1498 = ~Isra Ghadir? I have a message for you from Lady Corinna Ghadir.~
@1499 = ~From mother? Is she-- is something the matter?~
@1500 = ~Not that I know of, my lady. She merely wants you to know that she is in the city on business. She is staying in the Mithrest.~
@1501 = ~I see. Thank you very much, sir.~
@1502 = ~My apologies for the delay. Mother... well, business does bring her into Athkatla from time to time, though I suspect that her main reason for coming here now is Rana.~ [rh#is140]
@1503 = ~Is she a merchant herself?~
@1504 = ~You knew that was likely to happen eventually.~
@1505 = ~Do you want to visit her while she's around?~
@1506 = ~Could we move on now, then?~
@1507 = ~Aye, amongst other things. If we can find the time for it, I would like to visit her.~
@1508 = ~And I can't say that I'm terribly upset about it. If we can find the time, however, I would like to visit her.~
@1509 = ~I would, if we have the time for it.~
@1510 = ~I'm sure that she would love to meet you. Especially after the stress of Rana's legal predicaments, I expect that some good news would be very welcome right now, and you would certainly qualify as that.~
@1511 = ~You're sure she'd approve of me?~
@1512 = ~I don't see how meeting one daughter's lover makes up for another one being in prison.~
@1513 = ~Meeting your parents? Isn't that something of a... big step?~
@1514 = ~I'd be happy to drop by the Mithrest Inn and see her.~
@1515 = ~Don't look so uncertain, <CHARNAME>. My mother is a Sunite also, and you are handsome enough for any of us.~
@1516 = ~Don't look so uncertain, <CHARNAME>. My mother is a Sunite also, and you are beautiful enough for any of us.~
@1517 = ~It doesn't, though my mother is a Sunite also. Such news always means a great deal for us.~
@1518 = ~Don't look so uncertain, <CHARNAME>. My mother is a Sunite also, and very flexible about such things.~
@1519 = ~If you do meet her, of course, 'twill only be a matter of time before my father finds out as well, and he... whatever his thoughts are, he is unlikely to be very quiet about them.~
@1520 = ~I'd hate to be another point of contention between you two.~
@1521 = ~You don't expect him to disinherit you over it, I hope?~
@1522 = ~I'm not keen on being some dark secret for you.~
@1523 = ~You really do fight over literally everything, don't you?~
@1524 = ~You shouldn't worry so. 'Tis nothing out of the ordinary.~
@1525 = ~If he hasn't disowned Rana yet... no, I doubt that very much.~
@1526 = ~And I have no intention of making you one.~
@1527 = ~We are not quite as bad as that. I hope.~
@1528 = ~I do expect a good deal of hounding, of course. He has wanted me married off for years. To whom may be of little enough concern at this point.~
@1529 = ~He dreamed of Calishite noblemen once, but that is... unlikely, to put it mildly. More so now than ever.~
@1530 = ~Calishite noblemen? That's a very specific dream.~
@1531 = ~If it's a wedding he wants, I wouldn't mind obliging him.~
@1532 = ~No Calishite lord could ever hope to deserve you.~
@1533 = ~I can't imagine he'll be happy that I'm a northerner.~
@1534 = ~I can't imagine he'll be happy that I'm an elf.~
@1535 = ~I can't imagine he'll be happy that I'm a <PRO_RACE>.~
@1536 = ~I'm sure I'll be able to win him over eventually.~
@1537 = ~I doubt that he will be overly pleased to find me with another woman again, of course. He has always wanted a proper, traditional Calishite marriage for me, like his sisters had.~
@1538 = ~His daughters... well, we have all been less obliging.~
@1539 = ~I think I'm going to get along better with your mother.~
@1540 = ~I really can't see you in a traditional Calishite marriage.~
@1541 = ~I can't say that I regret that at all.~
@1542 = ~You've always seemed obliging enough to me.~
@1543 = ~And not one without cause, I'm afraid.~
@1544 = ~(laugh) Should I expect a two front war on that issue, then?~
@1545 = ~(laugh) They are not all terrible, though even the best of them...~
@1546 = ~I couldn't really say. I have never actually taken one as a lover before.~
@1547 = ~I couldn't really say. You are a paladin, at least... that usually counts for something with him.~
@1548 = ~I couldn't really say. He is likely to appreciate your devotion to the Red Knight. At my own expense, probably.~
@1549 = ~You might be able to. I certainly hope so, at least.~
@1550 = ~I certainly hope so. You are a paladin, at least. That usually counts for something with him.~
@1551 = ~I certainly hope so. He is likely to appreciate your devotion to the Red Knight. At my own expense, probably.~
@1552 = ~Most people do.~
@1553 = ~I... very nearly was in one once, I must admit.~
@1554 = ~(laugh) Nor do I.~
@1555 = ~(laugh) Where you are concerned, mayhap.~
@1556 = ~The last time my father was truly pleased with me, he had let himself believe that I was about to marry well and settle down. When that... collapsed... well, I do not think that he ever entirely forgave me.~
@1557 = ~You were going to get married? You're barely more than twenty!~
@1558 = ~I can't see you being happy settled down.~
@1559 = ~This certainly sounds like a promising story.~
@1560 = ~You were betrothed once and never thought to tell me?~
@1561 = ~For those of us with Calishite blood, 'tis more common than you realize. And it often ends as poorly as you might imagine.~
@1562 = ~Neither can I, and those particular circumstances... they left much to be desired.~
@1563 = ~Forgive me for not sharing that opinion. I seldom feel comfortable discussing past affairs when they end on good terms. When they do not...~
@1564 = ~'Twas less serious than it sounds, <CHARNAME>. You should know by now that I seldom feel comfortable discussing past affairs when they end on good terms. When they do not...~
@1565 = ~I'm sorry. I would share the tale, but thinking of my father never puts me in the most charitable of moods, and this story... he deserves better than to be slandered in a moment of spite.~
@1566 = ~I believe I promised you a story, <CHARNAME>.~ [rh#is141]
@1567 = ~About that torrid romance of yours?~
@1568 = ~You don't need to feel obligated to share it, Isra.~
@1569 = ~That depends. How rehearsed is it going to be by now?~
@1570 = ~I really don't want to hear it.~
@1571 = ~(laugh) 'Twas hardly torrid, though mayhap that is a matter of opinion.~
@1572 = ~'Twould hardly be fair of me to comment on it and then remain silent, though I thank you for your compassion.~
@1573 = ~'Twas hardly a matter of rehearsal. I simply needed some time to clear my head. Now, would you care to hear it or not?~
@1574 = ~I'm sorry. I would, please.~
@1575 = ~Fine. Go ahead, if you must.~
@1576 = ~I really don't want to.~
@1577 = ~... I've no desire to fight over this, <CHARNAME>. Mayhap 'twould be better simply to move on.~
@1578 = ~I see. If you would rather I kept my secrets... very well, then.~
@1579 = ~ I was... just under seventeen, as I recall. A child, really, with her head too full of fanciful stories. You must understand that when I was still in training, the Radiant Heart's armies would ride through Crimmor each spring. They were so similar and yet so different... that was always a fascinating mix for me.~
@1580 = ~When I met one of their squires at a tourney... 'twas love at first sight for both of us. Or so we thought. A Tyrran originally from Memnon... father liked that part as well. Most expatriated Calishites can only dream of marrying back into one of the ancient families.~
@1581 = ~I can't really see you as a starry eyed damsel.~
@1582 = ~You did once mention having history with the Church of Tyr.~
@1583 = ~I didn't realize Tyr was even worshipped in Calimshan.~
@1584 = ~Love at first sight, Isra? I didn't think you were into that.~
@1585 = ~I was young, <CHARNAME>. And foolish.~
@1586 = ~Aye... and one that was not entirely pleasant.~
@1587 = ~Aye, given how brutal that country tends to be, he has a larger following than you might think.~
@1588 = ~I am not, <CHARNAME>. This is part of the reason why.~
@1589 = ~Roshan and I... our relationship was always complicated by circumstance. Being squired to different orders, we seldom saw each other in person. Sir Evendur thought I was mad; Roshan's mentor... I cannot imagine that he was any happier.~
@1590 = ~Naturally we decided that the hardship only added to our love. 'Twas all highly romanticized. Too much so. We wrote letters for the most part. Elegant, emotional, devoid of any real content.~
@1591 = ~I would show you them, but I... ah, I'm afraid I burnt them all.~
@1592 = ~I doubt I would even want to look at them.~
@1593 = ~That was very melodramatic of you.~
@1594 = ~That's probably for the best.~
@1595 = ~Why wouldn't your mentors have been happy about it?~
@1596 = ~Probably not. I would not want to look at them again anyway.~
@1597 = ~I was seventeen, <CHARNAME>. Melodrama was an art to me.~
@1598 = ~Perhaps. I do like to keep tokens, but that... no, I imagine the memory itself is enough.~
@1599 = ~One adolescent paladin can be willful enough, <CHARNAME>. Two, however... would that I had heeded the warnings.~
@1600 = ~Courtly romance is a strange thing. I am not quite certain why so many of us are as susceptible to it as we are. I have discussed it with my clergy at some length, though no two clerics have ever given me the same answer.~
@1601 = ~One priest in particular, though... he suspected that 'twas the one place in a paladin's life where the forbidden became the ideal instead. As uneasy as that possibility is, I cannot help but think there is some truth to it.~
@1602 = ~One chance to break all the rules you set for yourselves?~
@1603 = ~One chance to break all the rules we set for ourselves?~
@1604 = ~I can see why you're so much more careful with romance now.~
@1605 = ~For you, perhaps. A Sunite should be in the minority.~
@1606 = ~That sounds like an exceedingly dangerous fantasy.~
@1607 = ~Aye. There are reasons it seldom ends well. Roshan and I...~
@1608 = ~Aye. Roshan and I were luckier than most, though I wouldn't say that we escaped unscathed.~
@1609 = ~In this matter, I think we are all rather similar. Roshan and I...~
@1610 = ~Aye. 'Tis one of the most dangerous ones, I think, for all of its beauty. Roshan and I...~
@1611 = ~'Twas a game to us, I think, though neither of us knew it at the time. We only really saw each other at tourneys, and I... I'm almost ashamed to admit it, but I enjoyed playing the role of the fair maiden at them too much to ever take up arms myself.~
@1612 = ~You're only young once. It's better to take advantage of it.~
@1613 = ~That has to be the vainest thing I have ever heard you say.~
@1614 = ~Would it be uncouth of me to wonder just how long you remained a maiden?~
@1615 = ~So you spent your time tying ribbons to his lances, did you?~
@1616 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>. That is probably a more forgiving stance than I deserve.~
@1617 = ~I hope it is. I would hate to think that I've ever said anything worse.~
@1618 = ~It would, though in answer... not very long at all.~
@1619 = ~<CHARNAME>... I am going to pretend that that isn't the crudest euphemism I have heard all <DAYNIGHT>.~
@1620 = ~As I've said, we were very young. And very foolish. I know that Roshan has since worked at eliminating certain... tendencies that come with a childhood spent in Calimshan, but I did not push him nearly as much as I should have.~
@1621 = ~We never communicated very well, never truly knew each other as well as we should have, and when the novelty finally wore off, he half expected me to enter some Calishite harem as his bride. Obviously that was never going to happen.~
@1622 = ~Things were said. On both of our parts. Terrible things... things I wish never to repeat. 'Twas years before I was even willing to speak to him again.~
@1623 = ~Things that made you dislike the Church of Tyr in general.~
@1624 = ~So much for paladinic courtesy.~
@1625 = ~Remind me never to get into a screaming match with you.~
@1626 = ~I can see why you prefer women now.~
@1627 = ~I'm sorry you had to deal with that, Isra.~
@1628 = ~Aye. There is no excuse for it, but it is what it is.~
@1629 = ~Aye. I make no excuses for whatever prejudices I still have. If I have ever said anything insulting... I am sorry.~
@1630 = ~I know, <CHARNAME>. When we slip... well, 'tis seldom a pleasant sight to behold.~
@1631 = ~(laugh) My temper is far better now than it was then, <CHARNAME>.~
@1632 = ~(laugh) I prefer you, certainly. I hardly quarrel with every man in Amn, though.~
@1633 = ~I am not sure that I am, truth be told. It taught me things I needed to know. But thank you, regardless.~
@1634 = ~He apologized much later, I should add. We both did. We were always very good at apologizing. Much better than we were at anything else.~
@1635 = ~And obviously I am still very good at that. I am almost inclined to apologize for subjecting you to this ugly tale at all, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.~
@1636 = ~You do apologize for almost everything else.~
@1637 = ~Don't apologize, Isra. I appreciate knowing.~
@1638 = ~Nobody seems to have died. It could be uglier by far.~
@1639 = ~You'd be better off apologizing for not sharing it sooner.~
@1640 = ~Aye... I suppose somtimes I do.~
@1641 = ~I suppose I can understand that as well.~
@1642 = ~Aye, that is true enough.~
@1643 = ~Mayhap that is true.~
@1644 = ~The other day... I do not share that story very often. I seldom care to even think about it, truth be told.~ [rh#is142]
@1645 = ~I can't really blame you for that.~
@1646 = ~And you won't even tell me what you two said to each other.~
@1647 = ~You don't share anything that might make you look bad, do you?~
@1648 = ~I don't need to hear any more about it. Let's move on.~
@1649 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>.~
@1650 = ~No... no, <CHARNAME>, I would rather not.~
@1651 = ~I shared it with you, <CHARNAME>.~
@1652 = ~If you would prefer it.~
@1653 = ~I must admit, I did not expect to feel such relief at telling you even that much. 'Tis hardly the darkest of secrets, I know, but there is something terribly ironic in it regardless.~
@1654 = ~So many assume that where romance is concerned, the Church of Sune has all of the answers... that the heart's mysteries are no great riddle to us.~
@1655 = ~Obviously that is not true.~
@1656 = ~I don't think that anyone would expect perfection of you.~
@1657 = ~Few Sunites have the same complications that you do.~
@1658 = ~That only makes you more attractive, Isra, not less.~
@1659 = ~There'd be little challenge in following our hearts if our goddess gave us the roadmap.~
@1660 = ~Anyone but myself? That may well be so.~
@1661 = ~Mayhap not, though certain complications may well be universal.~
@1662 = ~(smile) Little challenge and less reward... perhaps that is true.~
@1663 = ~What a pair we are, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. What a pair indeed. Give me your hand, would you? I would like to keep you close for at least a moment longer.~
@1664 = ~I used to think it strange, you know, the type of relationship that we have right now. Romance was always something to be saved for between quests. That made it brief and fleeting and seldom very real, but I thought it purer that way, untouched by violence and conflict.~
@1665 = ~It never actually was, of course. Perhaps I should have realized that sooner.~
@1666 = ~And this relationship we have now? What of it?~
@1667 = ~I think you realized it about as soon as you needed to.~
@1668 = ~I never really used to believe in love at all.~
@1669 = ~It's never wise to try to barricade parts of your life away.~
@1670 = ~(smile) What of it, indeed.~
@1671 = ~(smile) Aye, I would have to agree with that.~
@1672 = ~(smile) I would never have taken you for such a skeptic. At least you have changed your mind in the time since.~
@1673 = ~(smile) No, and I do not intend to do so again.~
@1674 = ~You and I, <CHARNAME>... I have become far too accustomed to making the most of a short period of time. I have had to be. People tend to move in and out of my life quickly. Friends, lovers... I have learned not to plan for forever.~
@1675 = ~It cannot be too much longer now until we get to the bottom of this. I hope... I hope you mean to remain in Amn afterward, if only for a time.~
@1676 = ~I would happily stay here for a lifetime, Isra.~
@1677 = ~I think I can commit to at least that much.~
@1678 = ~You don't plan to follow me if I leave?~
@1679 = ~I doubt I'll know until after it happens.~
@1680 = ~It heartens me to hear you say as much, my love.~
@1681 = ~I certainly hope so, my love.~
@1682 = ~You know that the choice is not entirely mine, <CHARNAME>.~
@1683 = ~No, I suppose mere intentions mean little in the absence of facts.~
@1684 = ~For now, however, 'twould be best not to look quite so far into the future, I think. Imoen... every day we wait is a day we lose. I am growing worried about what we might discover when we find her.~
@1685 = ~<CHARNAME>, you-- I'm almost afraid to ask what he did to you.~ [rh#is143]
@1686 = ~He... somehow he drained me of my soul. I don't know how.~
@1687 = ~And I'm almost afraid to tell you. He took my soul, Isra.~
@1688 = ~In case you didn't notice, we don't have time to discuss it.~
@1689 = ~He... he did what? I--~
@1690 = ~I don't even know what to say. Such things... this shouldn't even be possible.~
@1691 = ~Don't look so stunned. I'm the one who should be panicking.~
@1692 = ~I think the evidence speaks for itself.~
@1693 = ~Irenicus didn't expect me to survive it either.~
@1694 = ~You're not making me feel better about anything.~
@1695 = ~Mayhap not, but I worry for you. You look... terrible.~
@1696 = ~I feel even worse. He took my soul, Isra.~
@1697 = ~I'm still alive. For a <PRO_MANWOMAN> whose soul was stolen, that's impressive enough.~
@1698 = ~Your concern is appreciated, but we need to move. Now.~
@1699 = ~Aye, if you insist.~
@1700 = ~I am not panicking. Not yet, at least. I just have never heard of anybody surviving such a... a violation before.~
@1701 = ~I know. I just have never heard of anybody surviving such a... a violation before.~
@1702 = ~As far as I know, nobody else ever has.~
@1703 = ~I'm sorry. I just have never heard of anybody surviving such a... a violation before.~
@1704 = ~To lose one's soul is to die instantly. That much is common knowledge, but you... you and Imoen, that is...~
@1705 = ~Forgive me. I should not burden you with speculation.~
@1706 = ~This is hard enough as it is. Talking about it won't help.~
@1707 = ~If you have any theories, I'd rather know what they are.~
@1708 = ~You shouldn't. You should be glad that I'm simply alive.~
@1709 = ~Don't go silent on me, Isra. That's even more frightening.~
@1710 = ~Aye, I know. Once we have gotten through Bodhi's gauntlet... there will be time to talk then.~
@1711 = ~You are no normal <PRO_RACE>. That much has always been obvious. I should like to let myself think that if Irenicus has not actually consumed your soul, you are still tenuously linked to it, but... I don't know.~
@1712 = ~You think it's because of what I am, don't you?~
@1713 = ~I had this vision when he took it. A vision involving Bhaal.~
@1714 = ~So much for religious training.~
@1715 = ~The "why" of it doesn't matter. What matters is getting it back.~
@1716 = ~Aye, and I am glad. More so than I could put into words. But you are right; we ought to move on now.~
@1717 = ~'Tis as likely as anything, I'm afraid.~
@1718 = ~I... see. That is hardly surprising, though what it might mean, I could not say.~
@1719 = ~I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>. I wish I knew more, but we really haven't the time to ponder theories right now anyway.~
@1720 = ~Aye, you are right, of course. We really haven't the time to ponder theories right now anyway.~
@1721 = ~Once we have gotten through Bodhi's gauntlet... there will be time to talk then.~
@1722 = ~For a moment I let myself believe that it would truly be that simple. That we would wrest back your soul and this quest would finally be at an end.~ [rh#is144]
@1723 = ~'Twould seem that fate is never quite so kind.~
@1724 = ~I know. We get led on this merry little chase instead.~
@1725 = ~You needn't sound so resigned about it.~
@1726 = ~I wish that just once, something would go my way.~
@1727 = ~We'll find him again. We have to.~
@1728 = ~I need to concentrate, Isra. Just... stop it.~
@1729 = ~I cannot blame you for your bitterness.~
@1730 = ~I'm not resigned. I am worried.~
@1731 = ~I cannot fault you for that.~
@1732 = ~Aye, though in the meanwhile...~
@1733 = ~I... very well. If that is what you wish.~
@1734 = ~Are you... are you going to be alright? There is likely a long chase ahead of us now, and you... loath as I am to point it out, my <PRO_LADYLORD>, you look terrible.~
@1735 = ~I... I can't help but wonder how much more time we actually have.~
@1736 = ~Before I lose control and try to kill everyone?~
@1737 = ~That question weighs upon me enough as it is.~
@1738 = ~I'm not going to lie down and die. I promise you that much.~
@1739 = ~I don't really feel that terrible. I think we can do this.~
@1740 = ~As troubling as those transformations are, that is not what I was thinking. I--~
@1741 = ~I imagine it must. I--~
@1742 = ~I will hold you to that. I--~
@1743 = ~I... am not sure that you still have the capacity to feel it. I--~
@1744 = ~I am afraid for you, <CHARNAME>. I don't fear very much, but losing you to this... I do not care to even think about it.~
@1745 = ~Hold still a moment, <CHARNAME>. You look-- well, I would say you look tired, but that is nothing out of the ordinary.~ [rh#is145]
@1746 = ~You're beginning to look a bit tired yourself, Isra.~
@1747 = ~Being tired is the least of my problems right now.~
@1748 = ~Sleep has been... harder to come by now than ever.~
@1749 = ~Please, Isra, we don't have time to talk right now.~
@1750 = ~I can believe it. I--~
@1751 = ~I always realized that something terrible could happen, you know. I hoped that it would not, but I knew that it might.~
@1752 = ~In my experience, the worst usually does happen.~
@1753 = ~Being trapped down here isn't exactly a walk in the park, no.~
@1754 = ~This is a terrible world. There's nothing new there.~
@1755 = ~I know that things haven't been very pleasant as of late.~
@1756 = ~Aye, and the explanation for that...~
@1757 = ~Aye, though I was not speaking of that alone.~
@1758 = ~Aye, though I was not speaking of the world at large.~
@1759 = ~I am not exactly naive, <CHARNAME>. What you are... I don't comment on it very often, but that does not mean that I have never considered it.~
@1760 = ~I told myself that it did not matter, of course, that even the ugliest of heritages could be surmounted. Whether that is actually true... we shall find out soon enough.~
@1761 = ~Faith, Isra. That's all that matters in the end.~
@1762 = ~You don't... regret anything now, do you?~
@1763 = ~We've survived thus far. Surely we can manage a bit longer.~
@1764 = ~You have been awfully morose lately.~
@1765 = ~I would not deny that.~
@1766 = ~No, <CHARNAME>. Never that.~
@1767 = ~I can only pray that you are right.~
@1768 = ~There has been precious little as of late to be pleased about.~
@1769 = ~(sigh) 'Tis strange to think of how many tales like this I have heard over the years. The quest to rescue the doomed lover, 'tis the song of choice for any Sunite bard. To actually live it, however...~
@1770 = ~That is something else entirely.~
@1771 = ~But some of those stories have to be based in fact, right?~
@1772 = ~Hopefully it'll be worth retelling once it's over.~
@1773 = ~I'm going to get through this, Isra. We both are.~
@1774 = ~It's not quite as romantic as in the stories, is it?~
@1775 = ~Mayhap, though which is truth and which is fabrication...~
@1776 = ~Aye, if it ends well, I expect it will be.~
@1777 = ~Aye, we can only hope so.~
@1778 = ~No... nor is it nearly as glorious.~
@1779 = ~I am sorry, <CHARNAME>. I know that you don't need this from me right now. Your thoughts must already be heavy enough as it is.~
@1780 = ~And getting heavier by the moment.~
@1781 = ~Talking about it does help a bit.~
@1782 = ~I love you, Isra. You do know that, I hope.~
@1783 = ~Your concern means more to me than stoicism would.~
@1784 = ~I am sorry for that as well.~
@1785 = ~Then I am glad of that much.~
@1786 = ~(smile) I hoped... I had hoped that you still could. Perhaps that will be enough.~
@1787 = ~(smile) I have never been very good at pretending I don't care.~
@1788 = ~Sit with me, my-- Veldrin, while we have even a moment's privacy. I wanted to... hmm.~ [rh#is146]
@1789 = ~Ow, Isra, that's my chin you're grabbing.~
@1790 = ~What are you doing? You don't need to study me that hard.~
@1791 = ~I'm not sure there's any such thing as privacy here.~
@1792 = ~As much as I enjoy the affection, I doubt the drow will be very impressed.~
@1793 = ~I'm sorry. I did not mean to hurt you. I had hoped to find something familiar in your features.~
@1794 = ~I had hoped to find something familiar in your features. Some sign of <CHARNAME> instead of Veldrin.~
@1795 = ~Then I shall take a brief risk. I had hoped to find something familiar in your features.~
@1796 = ~Then forgive me the transgression. I had hoped to find something familiar in your features.~
@1797 = ~They say that the eyes are the window to the soul, but then, you have no soul at the moment. Perhaps that is why I see so very little of you in them now.~
@1798 = ~You look as strange as I do, I assure you.~
@1799 = ~Good. If you could tell, then so could our enemies.~
@1800 = ~Then look closer. I'm still myself underneath.~
@1801 = ~You don't like the new look? Some might consider it an improvement.~
@1802 = ~Do not remind me. I have taken to avoiding mirrors as of late.~
@1803 = ~I imagine you are likely right about that.~
@1804 = ~I believe it, but seeing you like this... being like this myself...~
@1805 = ~Then they would be fools.~
@1806 = ~I have never understood why some people considered the drow enchanting. Now I understand it even less. There is nothing about this place that isn't utterly loathsome to me.~
@1807 = ~None of us are enjoying this, Isra. At least, I'm not.~
@1808 = ~They do have a sort of deadly beauty about them, though.~
@1809 = ~This city is a farce. A complete travesty.~
@1810 = ~Solaufein seems decent enough, all things considered.~
@1811 = ~Aye, I know. I would be worried if you were.~
@1812 = ~Beauty? There is guile here, but beauty... I see none of that.~
@1813 = ~Aye, and that is the kindest thing that can be said about it.~
@1814 = ~He does. Would that he were not so unique in this city.~
@1815 = ~(sigh) We cannot afford to speak so frankly. Not in this place. The very walls likely have ears, and as much as I hate this deception, I should hate to ruin it even more.~
@1816 = ~Yes, that would be somewhat awkward for all of us.~
@1817 = ~Spend the night with me. It'd look odd if you refused all pleasure here.~
@1818 = ~Don't you think you should have considered that a bit sooner?~
@1819 = ~It will be over soon enough. Just keep your head down a while longer.~
@1820 = ~You have a gift for understatement, <CHARNAME>. Good night.~
@1821 = ~Do drow females partake of each other's company? If they do, I doubt I would much care for their pleasures.~
@1822 = ~Regardless, I could not. Not whilst under this spell. 'Twould be a mockery to me.~
@1823 = ~No, <CHARNAME>, I couldn't. Not whilst under this spell. 'Twould be a mockery to me.~
@1824 = ~Mayhap, though I needed to speak with you, if only for a brief moment. But you are right. Good night, <CHARNAME>.~
@1825 = ~I have little enough alternative. Good night, <CHARNAME>.~
@1826 = ~By Sune, I never imagined that Athkatla could be such a welcome sight.~ [rh#is147]
@1827 = ~It's nice to finally see you high-spirited again.~
@1828 = ~We do have a mission here, don't forget.~
@1829 = ~It doesn't seem quite so corrupt and miserable now, does it?~
@1830 = ~It's not the only welcome sight here, I hope.~
@1831 = ~Isra, we don't have the time for this right now.~
@1832 = ~Aye, it has been far too long, I know.~
@1833 = ~Aye, though I can enjoy the sights regardless.~
@1834 = ~(laugh) Oh, it is still that, though I can almost enjoy it regardless.~
@1835 = ~(laugh) Far from it, <CHARNAME>. Far from it indeed.~
@1836 = ~Then that is a pity.~
@1837 = ~Would that we had more than a moment to spare right now, however. Seeing you once more, finally looking like yourself again...~
@1838 = ~I cannot begin to tell you how much I have missed that as well.~
@1839 = ~You're certainly welcome to *show* me, my dear.~
@1840 = ~No more than I have missed your face, Isra.~
@1841 = ~I guess that's my cue to avoid changing into the Slayer.~
@1842 = ~No? You don't exactly sound at a loss for words right now.~
@1843 = ~Oh, am I? The thought is rather tempting.~
@1844 = ~Oh, my <PRO_LADYLORD>, what a delightful flatterer you can be.~
@1845 = ~... Don't jest so, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. Not right now.~
@1846 = ~Mayhap not, though having the correct words is a different matter entirely. Right now I fear I am somewhat too exhausted for that.~
@1847 = ~After Ust Natha... please, <CHARNAME>, just walk with me a while. Time may be short, but to finally be in a city where one can love without fear of reprisal...~
@1848 = ~By the gods, the alternative is horrifying.~
@1849 = ~You're still thinking about Solaufein and Phaere, aren't you?~
@1850 = ~Please tell me you don't suddenly see Underdark crusades in your future.~
@1851 = ~Time may be short right now, but once this is over...~
@1852 = ~Of all the horrors of Ust Natha, you *would* focus upon that one.~
@1853 = ~I will never stop thinking of them. Nor would I wish to. I've heard tales of tragic love before, but that one... that one will stay with me forever.~
@1854 = ~Oh, no. That battle is not mine, and thank the gods for that. I would gladly never set foot there again.~
@1855 = ~Once this is over... oh, that is another story entirely. And a more pleasant one, I hope.~
@1856 = ~I would. I do not disregard any of the others, but that one... it almost makes me pity them instead.~
@1857 = ~(sigh) But forgive me. This is a poor time for distractions. We should be considering the present for now, not the past or the future.~
@1858 = ~The coming challenges... I hope you deem us ready for them.~
@1859 = ~Do you expect them to be any worse than the previous ones?~
@1860 = ~I hope you're not getting cold feet at this late date.~
@1861 = ~We have to be. There's no more time for preparations.~
@1862 = ~To be honest, I'm still surprised we even made it this far.~
@1863 = ~We've beaten them before. We can do it again.~
@1864 = ~'Tis best to assume so. Overconfidence is as deadly a foe as any, though you, my <PRO_LADYLORD>... you have often proved more dangerous still.~
@1865 = ~I am getting serious, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. That is a different thing altogether. Overconfidence is as deadly a foe as any, though you... you have often proved more dangerous still.~
@1866 = ~No, I imagine not, but mayhap they will not prove necessary. You are as competent a <PRO_MANWOMAN> as any I have ever know.~
@1867 = ~You should not be, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. You are as competent a <PRO_MANWOMAN> as any I have ever know.~
@1868 = ~Aye, I imagine we can. You are as competent a <PRO_MANWOMAN> as any I have ever know, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.~
@1869 = ~But the time for talk has passed, I think. Come, let us finish this.~
@1870 = ~I should thank you again, <CHARNAME>. What Bodhi did... were you anyone else, I doubt you would be able to imagine it, but I suspect that you can.~ [rh#is150]
@1871 = ~I am developing a nasty habit of getting kidnapped myself.~
@1872 = ~That whole experience must have been terrible for you.~
@1873 = ~I was never going to just abandon you, Isra.~
@1874 = ~I'm just glad your people didn't ask us to slay a dragon for them.~
@1875 = ~So I have noticed. Vampires may well be the only captors you have avoided at this point.~
@1876 = ~It was. You do not know the half of it.~
@1877 = ~(smile) I know that. And I am grateful for it.~
@1878 = ~(laugh) Oh, my people are quite capable of slaying dragons themselves, though I did not mean helping me with my order. Not only, at least.~
@1879 = ~The memory fades quickly, thank Sune, but what little I do remember...~
@1880 = ~I hated everything, <CHARNAME>. Everything. I hated you, I... I even hated *her*. After that, I couldn't just go back to what I had been again. Not with such memories as that.~
@1881 = ~So your fall wasn't specifically tied to doing evil?~
@1882 = ~You still haven't forgotten it entirely, though.~
@1883 = ~At least your order was supportive throughout it.~
@1884 = ~You hated your goddess? No wonder she told you to get lost.~
@1885 = ~To hate as much as that, <CHARNAME>... that is evil. I know no other word for it.~
@1886 = ~I haven't, no, though 'tis vague enough to be bearable now.~
@1887 = ~I know. Sir Evendur... he has enough experience of his own coping with terrible things. His sympathy does not surprise me.~
@1888 = ~I... did. I don't know who turned away from whom in the aftermath, but the specifics of it make little difference.~
@1889 = ~Our evening spent with Ilian... redemption can be a strange thing at times. I wouldn't have expected that simply discussing it would help so, but mayhap there is something to be said for disowning a story and handing it over to the minstrels instead.~
@1890 = ~He certainly made us repeat it enough times.~
@1891 = ~I'm just glad that something so simple was so effective.~
@1892 = ~Good for you. I'm still having nightmares about that bard.~
@1893 = ~You're a Sunite, my dear. That comes with certain eccentricities.~
@1894 = ~I think he needed to.~
@1895 = ~Aye, so am I.~
@1896 = ~Oh, he was not quite as bad as that.~
@1897 = ~How very observant of you.~
@1898 = ~I... you know, I don't think I ever understood violation before. Not truly. I could sympathize, certainly, but sympathy is painless enough.~
@1899 = ~What was done to you in Spellhold, <CHARNAME>... I always knew it was terrible, but now I can appreciate exactly what that entails.~
@1900 = ~I would not trade back that knowledge if I could.~
@1901 = ~Ignorance may be bliss, but it's still ignorance.~
@1902 = ~At least you've actually been restored now. I haven't.~
@1903 = ~Does understanding it actually help at all?~
@1904 = ~If you can find some meaning in this, I won't begrudge you that.~
@1905 = ~I do not disagree. It gives me reason to wonder, though.~
@1906 = ~You will be, though... I'm beginning to wonder what that might mean for you.~
@1907 = ~I think so, though... it gives me reason to wonder.~
@1908 = ~I can, though... it gives me reason to wonder.~
@1909 = ~Recovering your soul won't simply wash away everything that has happened. I assumed at first that it would, but now I doubt it. A thing once broken can never again be whole. Not truly whole, at least.~
@1910 = ~Once this is over... what do you think we are going to be, <CHARNAME>? We won't be what we were when it began. That much I am sure of.~
@1911 = ~I wish I knew. Hopefully we'll survive that long.~
@1912 = ~I didn't think you were interested in an ever after before.~
@1913 = ~We'll be ourselves, I suspect. Just a little bit older.~
@1914 = ~Promise me you'll stick around to find out.~
@1915 = ~Aye, I suppose that should be the first priority. The rest can wait until afterward.~
@1916 = ~I... wasn't, no. I think that might have changed as well.~
@1917 = ~I suspect that may be another thing to consider once this is over.~
@1918 = ~Older and wiser... I suspect you are right.~
@1919 = ~I... I do not make promises I am not certain I can keep, though in this case, I wish I could.~
@1920 = ~Well. That was quite easily the most pleasant conversation I've had with an Ophal in years.~
@1921 = ~You considered that pleasant?~
@1922 = ~I don't recall you actually saying anything.~
@1923 = ~They seemed a delightful bunch in general.~
@1924 = ~Hilarious, I'm sure.~
@1925 = ~You have never met their cousins in Crimmor.~
@1926 = ~And thank Sune that I did not have to.~
@1927 = ~I don't mean to laugh, but you have never met their cousins in Crimmor.~
@1928 = ~I'm happy they did not recognize me. Our families have been feuding for... oh, I couldn't even say how long.~
@1929 = ~If they had been aware of my kinship with House Crytrapper, we would likely still be screaming at each other.~
@1930 = ~You Amnian nobles can be too much at times.~
@1931 = ~I guess I should consider myself lucky to simply be snubbed.~
@1932 = ~A screaming match? So much for courtesy.~
@1933 = ~Now, that'd be a sight. Perhaps we should go back and introduce you.~
@1934 = ~I certainly do.~
@1935 = ~Perhaps not literally screaming, but one never can tell.~
@1936 = ~(laugh) No, I don't think so.~
@1937 = ~I had forgotten how beautiful these halls were. My memories of the place... well, they could stand to be somewhat more pleasant.~
@1938 = ~More pleasant? What happened?~
@1939 = ~You've been here before?~
@1940 = ~I'd have expected you to be more comfortable here.~
@1941 = ~You don't spend that much time with the Radiant Heart?~
@1942 = ~Suffice it to say that my mentor thought it best not to return.~
@1943 = ~Once. My mentor thought it best not to return.~
@1944 = ~"Comfortable" is not the way I would describe my last visit. Suffice it to say that my mentor thought it best not to return.~
@1945 = ~Ah... no. Suffice it to say that my mentor thought it best not to return.~
@1946 = ~He had come to speak with one of the older knights on some matter or another, and I'm afraid I got into a rather... heated discussion with several of the Tyrran squires.~
@1947 = ~I doubt that anyone here would still remember it.~
@1948 = ~Let's hope not. That's all we need.~
@1949 = ~I'll be extremely amused if they do.~
@1950 = ~They're probably used to troublesome squires anyway.~
@1951 = ~That would probably depend on just how loud this discussion of yours was.~
@1952 = ~I'm guessing Keldorn remembers it now.~
@1953 = ~'Twould be slightly awkward, aye.~
@1954 = ~I can believe that too easily.~
@1955 = ~I imagine they would have to be.~
@1956 = ~'Twas loud enough, unfortunately.~
@1957 = ~Do not concern yourselves over such things. We hold no grudges over the antics of squires.~
@1958 = ~I thought not, though I'm glad to hear it regardless.~
@1959 = ~I cannot decide whether or not to consider this a victory. I am in no mood for celebrating, at least.~
@1960 = ~Neither is Mazzy, I suspect.~
@1961 = ~I suppose that rules out a night of debauchery.~
@1962 = ~Too many good people are dead for that.~
@1963 = ~At least the village is safer now than it was yesterday.~
@1964 = ~We're still alive. Our resident Shade Lord isn't.~
@1965 = ~No... no, I cannot imagine that she would be.~
@1966 = ~I would certainly not be joining you.~
@1967 = ~The village is, aye.~
@1968 = ~We are, aye.~
@1969 = ~I know we had no hope of saving these people. Their fates were sealed long before we found them, but I don't like to pretend that makes this an acceptable outcome.~
@1970 = ~I don't think anyone disagrees with you.~
@1971 = ~We did save them. They're no longer undead, at least.~
@1972 = ~We did everything we could. You can't expect miracles.~
@1973 = ~They made the decision to tangle with that creature.~
@1974 = ~Just once I would like to see a victory that did not come with such a terrible price.~
@1975 = ~That is something to hold onto, though just once I would like to see a victory that did not come with such a terrible price.~
@1976 = ~I know, though just once I would like to see a victory that did not come with such a terrible price.~
@1977 = ~And so did we. Just once I would like to see a victory that did not come with such a terrible price.~
@1978 = ~A red dragon... I had not thought to find one here.~
@1979 = ~'Tis no small matter when beasts such as that take an interest in you, my <LADYLORD>.~
@1980 = ~Everyone seems to be taking an interest in me these days.~
@1981 = ~You're not worried about it, are you?~
@1982 = ~Well, he won't bother us again.~
@1983 = ~Hopefully he actually will leave us alone.~
@1984 = ~I wonder how many other grudges I've inherited.~
@1985 = ~I cannot say that it really surprises me.~
@1986 = ~I'm grateful for that much.~
@1987 = ~I would not count on it.~
@1988 = ~More than a few, I would guess.~
@1989 = ~Your foster father... I would have liked to have known him, I think. If this is any indication, he must have had scores of stories to tell.~
@1990 = ~You would have liked him a lot, I think.~
@1991 = ~Given his age, it wouldn't surprise me.~
@1992 = ~Good luck getting a Harper to tell a story straight.~
@1993 = ~This was another one he never told me.~
@1994 = ~We will need to return for him at some point, you must realize. Would that your foster father had finished the deed.~
@1995 = ~Trust a Harper to leave a deed half done.~
@1996 = ~I only wish he had told me about it at all.~
@1997 = ~I doubt he had much of a say in the matter.~
@1998 = ~It would certainly have saved me a lot of trouble.~
@1999 = ~I believe so as well.~
@2000 = ~Aye, one does not survive that long without accumulating a number of tales.~
@2001 = ~That is quite ungracious of you, <CHARNAME>.~
@2002 = ~I'm sorry to hear that, though tales of dragons... they are easier to share when they end in true victory.~
@2003 = ~Aye, when a foe has wings... that does complicate matters.~
@2004 = ~Aye, and the rest of the Windspear Hills as well.~
@2005 = ~I knew it would come to this eventually, but I did not want to believe it.~
@2006 = ~Shadow Thieves, <CHARNAME>? Are you certain there were no other options?~
@2007 = ~Taking the higher road here is only going to get Imoen killed.~
@2008 = ~There was one, if you recall.~
@2009 = ~What's done is done. There's no use second guessing it now.~
@2010 = ~The city is ruled by thieves anyway. At least these are honest ones.~
@2011 = ~Then I can only hope that our association with them proves short.~
@2012 = ~I don't consider *that* an option, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.~
@2013 = ~Do not make the mistake of considering them honest, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.~
@2014 = ~By Sune, that... establishment was utterly revolting. I won't validate it by calling it a festhall, whatever it purported to be.~
@2015 = ~Though it shouldn't surprise me that these tyrants take more pleasure in suffering than in anything real.~
@2016 = ~At least we've shut it down now.~
@2017 = ~Calm down, Isra. We're not about to start a crusade here.~
@2018 = ~What do you think will happen to those people now?~
@2019 = ~You might want to save your anger for Spellhold. That may be worse.~
@2020 = ~Aye, though I wonder if it will be enough.~
@2021 = ~Would that we could. I doubt that what we've done will be enough.~

@2027 = ~We have to let these people take care of themselves eventually.~
@2028 = ~I hope you're not planning something stupid.~
@2029 = ~We can worry about that after we've saved Imoen.~
@2030 = ~We can worry about that after we've dealt with Irenicus.~
@2031 = ~Not easily, mayhap, though this isn't a problem that can be solved overnight anyway.~
@2032 = ~Eventually, mayhap, but they don't have the means right now. This isn't a problem that can be solved overnight, though.~
@2033 = ~No, I'm not. This isn't a problem that can be solved overnight anyway.~
@2034 = ~Aye. This isn't a problem that can be solved overnight anyway.~
@2035 = ~Depending upon what we find in Spellhold, perhaps the Council of Six could be persuaded to take an interest in this island. I don't know.~
@2036 = ~Do you really think they'd care about Brynnlaw?~
@2037 = ~They should be paying more attention to the Cowled Wizards than they do.~
@2038 = ~Someone ought to wipe this nest of pirates out, once and for all.~
@2039 = ~We can't afford to worry about that right now.~
@2040 = ~Considering what we found in Spellhold, perhaps the Council of Six could be persuaded to take an interest in this island. I don't know.~
@2041 = ~No, I don't. But a place such as Spellhold potentially in the hands of pirates... that is enough to worry anyone.~
@2042 = ~They should. A place such as Spellhold potentially in the hands of pirates... that is enough to worry anyone.~
@2043 = ~And someone probably will. A place such as Spellhold potentially in the hands of pirates... that is enough to worry anyone.~
@2044 = ~You're probably right.~
@2045 = ~Enough of this. Speaking about it is only going to make me angrier, and I need a clear head for what likely lies ahead.~
@2046 = ~<CHARNAME>, you-- I can't imagine what this must be like for you.~ [rh#is151]
@2047 = ~Is there anything I can do to help? Pardon me for being frank, but you look terrible.~
@2048 = ~I don't think there's anything anyone can do.~
@2049 = ~I feel even worse, I assure you.~

@2056 = ~I... I know. I'm sorry.~
@2057 = ~I have heard tales of people who lost their souls, but I know of none who lingered on after the fact. This is... uncanny.~
@2058 = ~(sigh) I am not doing a very good job of reassuring you.~
@2059 = ~Well, someone had to be the first to survive, I suppose.~
@2060 = ~I would never have asked you for false hope.~
@2061 = ~Thank you for at least trying.~
@2062 = ~I really don't want to talk about this, Isra.~
@2063 = ~That is one way of looking at it.~
@2064 = ~Mayhap you should get some rest. You may not feel better come the morrow, but... hopefully you won't feel any worse.~
@2065 = ~I have seen dragons before, but metallic ones... how absurd it is to first meet one in the Underdark! Of all the creatures we could come across here, I was not expecting that at all.~
@2066 = ~The irony of the situation isn't lost upon me.~
@2067 = ~It's about time we ran into something pleasant for a change.~
@2068 = ~Save the euphoria for after we've done her bidding.~

@2071 = ~Aye, would that it could last. What they took from her...~

@2084 = ~I doubt that will be as easy as you make it sound.~
@2085 = ~I doubt that.~
@2086 = ~I would almost pity her, you know. Phaere. What she might have been, had circumstances allowed it. What they both might have been.~
@2087 = ~Even drow can love. Who would have thought?~
@2088 = ~I feel worse for Solaufein. He's the one with a heart.~
@2089 = ~I do pity her. This is no way to live a life.~
@2090 = ~This is a city of drow. How did you expect it to end?~
@2091 = ~Any being can. Any mortal being, at least.~
@2092 = ~Though whether that is due to luck or to integrity, I couldn't say.~
@2093 = ~No, it is not. I think it a shame.~
@2094 = ~Precisely as it did, though I think it a shame.~
@2095 = ~Every time I see something like this, <CHARNAME>... I would feel vindicated if it were not so sad. They call it weakness, they call it folly, but they still stamp it out wherever they find it. That is a mark of fear, not of contempt.~

@2097 = ~There's hope, I think. Look at Solaufein.~
@2098 = ~If their goddess has any say in the matter, we'll never know.~
@2099 = ~I intend to be out of here long before we have a chance to find out.~
@2100 = ~It'd be stabler, I think. More cooperative. More dangerous to the rest of us.~
@2101 = ~I have been, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. I certainly have.~
@2102 = ~Indeed, though 'twould seem that she is not the only one with an interest here. Solaufein's Eilistraee... well, there is room for hope, at least.~
@2103 = ~(laugh) Yes, I would prefer that as well.~
@2104 = ~Mayhap, though I would not be so certain. A little bit of empathy can go a very long way at times.~
@2105 = ~Are you quite mad, <CHARNAME>? What were you thinking, encouraging that... that vile creature?~
@2106 = ~Are you jealous, Isra? I wouldn't have expected that from you.~
@2107 = ~Calm down, Isra... it's only a ploy.~
@2108 = ~It's hardly your business whom I flirt with, Isra.~
@2109 = ~Jealous? I worry for your eyes if you find that disgusting woman attractive. I'm horrified that you would play this game with her at all.~
@2110 = ~I can't say that I see the need for such nonsense.~
@2111 = ~No? If you are so indiscriminate that you would cast your eyes at a dark elf, then I suppose that is true enough.~
@2112 = ~You-- what happened, <CHARNAME>? Tell me.~
@2113 = ~Calm down, Isra. It wasn't that bad. Far from it, actually.~
@2114 = ~I'm sorry. I wasn't sure she'd take 'no' for an answer.~
@2115 = ~She forced me, Isra. I didn't want to.~
@2116 = ~Step by step, or would you like a diagram instead?~
@2117 = ~And to think that I worried for you. I shan't bother to do that again.~
@2118 = ~No, I'm sure refusal would have been fatal, and resistance even worse...~
@2119 = ~I will see her *dead* for this, I swear it. As soon as we find the dragon's eggs. Are you--~
@2120 = ~No, of course you are not alright. What a foolish thing to ask. Let us try to bury this until we have the chance to finally redress it.~
@2121 = ~By Sune, 'tis good to see the sky again... and to finally have a task that is unlikely to drive me half mad with fury.~
@2122 = ~I know the feeling.~
@2123 = ~These elves don't seem to be much of an improvement.~
@2124 = ~I'm certainly looking forward to evening the score with Bodhi.~
@2125 = ~Perhaps I should congratulate you on not melting down completely in Ust Natha.~
@2126 = ~They may not be the most amiable of people, but they are also not drow.~
@2127 = ~As am I, I assure you.~
@2128 = ~Aye, though another moment in that place... I don't know.~
@2129 = ~We ought to make haste for Athkatla, <CHARNAME>. I have never wanted to see it more than I do right now, and I do not say that lightly.~
@2130 = ~<CHARNAME>, I should like to warn you that I don't care for some of the decisions that you have been making. I trust that you will rectify matters as quickly as possible?~
@2131 = ~If people look at us poorly, it's only because of Viconia.~
@2132 = ~I'm afraid this is how I operate.~
@2133 = ~Don't worry, I intend to.~
@2134 = ~Then see to it that we compensate properly for the Sharran's presence.~
@2135 = ~I see. Then I'm afraid I have little choice but to take my leave of your company.~
@2136 = ~I certainly hope so.~
@2137 = ~I had thought you better than this, <CHARNAME>, but I see that I was mistaken. In honor of our former friendship, I won't take action against you now, but I pray our paths don't meet again.~
@2138 = ~<CHARNAME>, might I have a brief word? Privately?~
@2139 = ~Of course, Isra. What is it?~
@2140 = ~This sounds somewhat ominous.~
@2141 = ~Whatever it is, I don't want to hear it.~
@2142 = ~I am growing somewhat concerned about Viconia. I may not have objected to her presence, but I have seen the way that she eyes you, <CHARNAME>. I can only wonder what her ulterior motive might be.~
@2143 = ~She may be drow, but she's as in need of support as anyone.~
@2144 = ~Can you drop the judgmental paladin act for once?~
@2145 = ~What do you want me to do? Kick her out?~
@2146 = ~I've been wondering much the same thing.~
@2147 = ~So I see.~
@2148 = ~She is in the service of Shar, my Lord. Do not assume that she thinks like you do.~
@2149 = ~Act? She is in the service of Shar, my Lord, and the foulness of that allegiance clings to her like a second skin.~
@2150 = ~'Tis no great stretch to assume that she means you ill.~
@2151 = ~I would hardly regret that choice, though I won't ask you to make it.~
@2152 = ~All I can do is warn you to turn down her... advances, such as they are. Whatever she might feel for you, my Lord, 'tis far removed from love.~
@2153 = ~Maybe now, though who can say what the future may bring?~
@2154 = ~I'm more interested in lust than love anyway.~
@2155 = ~If you're so worried, I'll have to tell her to stop.~
@2156 = ~She's less attractive than she thinks she is anyway... especially compared to you.~
@2157 = ~(sigh) I cannot tell you what to do, but... be careful. Please.~
@2158 = ~I see. I cannot tell you what to do, but... be careful. Please.~
@2159 = ~Hopefully she will actually listen.~
@2160 = ~(laugh) I would not normally appreciate being compared to a dark elf, but in this context, I cannot say that I mind it at all.~
@2161 = ~I would speak of Anomen, my Lady. I tried to speak to him earlier myself, but he was... not exactly amenable.~
@2162 = ~I have seen the way he looks at you. The way he speaks with you. He is a good enough man, 'tis true, but... please, make sure he is not so blinded by the idea of you that he fails to see the mortal woman beneath.~
@2163 = ~I have seen the alternative. 'Tis seldom pleasant for anybody involved.~
@2164 = ~You dislike courtly love? What sort of Sunite are you anyway?~
@2165 = ~You're not just saying this because you don't like him, I hope.~
@2166 = ~Thank you for the advice, Isra. I'll keep that in mind.~
@2167 = ~As attractive as knights in shining armor can be, I actually prefer the female ones.~
@2168 = ~One who can tell the difference between stories and reality.~
@2169 = ~No... no, I hope that I would not be so petty.~
@2170 = ~I will not tell you what to do, and I shan't say that any romance between you is doomed to failure, but be careful, <CHARNAME>. Please.~
@2171 = ~(laugh) Oh, do you? Then I can't say I regret this conversation at all.~
@2172 = ~If you do not share his affections, though, you should tell him, and sooner rather than later. 'Tis no kindess to give him false hope.~
@2173 = ~<CHARNAME>, do you... do you have a moment? I wanted to ask you something.~
@2174 = ~Of course I do. What is it?~
@2175 = ~Fine, but make it quick.~
@2176 = ~For you? No, Aerie, not right now.~
@2177 = ~You seem to be talking to Isra a lot recently. Do you... do you think that she's pretty?~
@2178 = ~Not nearly as pretty as you are, Aerie.~
@2179 = ~Pretty? I think that's a bit of an understatement.~
@2180 = ~She's definitely pleasant enough company.~
@2181 = ~I wouldn't kick her out of bed, though I'll need to find a way to get her there first.~
@2182 = ~Then... then that answers my question, I guess. I... I'm sorry.~
@2183 = ~Oh! I--I don't know if that's true, but thank you for saying so. You don't... you don't like her, then? Like *that*, I mean.~
@2184 = ~No, Aerie, I don't. Not with you around.~
@2185 = ~I might. Do you think she's actually interested?~
@2186 = ~Actually, I do. Very much so.~
@2187 = ~Your jealousy is not very becoming, you know.~
@2188 = ~Oh. The does that mean that you... that you like her? Like *that*, I mean.~
@2189 = ~Y-you are a very bad man, <CHARNAME>! I'm going to tell her that you said that!~
@2190 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>. That is very kind of you.~
@2191 = ~I--I think she might be.~
@2192 = ~I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>. I don't want to talk right now.~
@2193 = ~Oh. I... I see. Thank you for telling me the truth, <CHARNAME>.~
@2194 = ~I wasn't... I wasn't jealous! Ohh, never mind!~
@2195 = ~I expect to one day find that you have accidentally drowned yourself in that new perfume of yours, child.~
@2196 = ~... Does the scent trouble you in some way, Jaheira?~
@2197 = ~It is not the scent that concerns me, but your lack of focus. Your carefully cultivated beauty is of no use on the battlefield.~
@2198 = ~How strange. I had always thought that Harpers preached religious tolerance... especially amongst those faiths that supported their activities.~
@2199 = ~Hmph. You cannot wave your faith about as an excuse for everything you do, Isra. Your habits have changed recently. Do not think that I did not notice that deeper shade of lip stain that you purchased.~
@2200 = ~'Twas my own money, I assure you.~
@2201 = ~I did not think otherwise. But I will warn you now not to indulge your taste for cosmetics merely because you find a man attractive. He is not the type to appreciate such superficial concerns anyway.~
@2202 = ~Oh. Oh, I see.~
@2203 = ~You see what exactly?~
@2204 = ~Nothing I care to share.~
@2205 = ~Jaheira, I have no desire to argue with you over this. Or over anything else, preferably. I assure you, my focus is as strong as it ever was... regardless of which shade I paint my lips.~
@2206 = ~For one who has no wish to argue, you are surprisingly combative.~
@2207 = ~<CHARNAME>, I thought that this would work, but I'm beginning to believe that I was mistaken. I'll remain at your side, but more than that...~
@2208 = ~I'm sorry.~
@2209 = ~<CHARNAME>... mmm, good morrow, my love.~ [rh#is152]
@2210 = ~"My love?" I could get used to that.~
@2211 = ~You're not usually still abed this late in the morning.~
@2212 = ~Last night, Isra... I hope you enjoyed it also.~
@2213 = ~I... don't think this is such a good idea. I'm sorry.~
@2214 = ~I tend to use the word sparingly, but after last night, I cannot help but think it appropriate.~
@2215 = ~No, 'tis undisciplined of me, I know, but for one morning, at least, I couldn't make myself leave your side.~
@2216 = ~You needn't be so bashful, <CHARNAME>. It was wonderful. You were wonderful.~
@2217 = ~Every moment of it, though I am sure you already knew that.~
@2218 = ~You... I see. Then... I suppose we shall speak no more of it.~
@2219 = ~Excuse me, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. I won't abandon you, but... I've no wish to look at you right now.~
@2220 = ~If we could lie here all morning... listen to me. One evening together and I am already speaking like an idle hedonist.~
@2221 = ~(smile) I shall need to be careful of you, I think.~
@2222 = ~There's nothing wrong with a bit of relaxation, Isra.~
@2223 = ~Not *too* careful, I hope.~
@2224 = ~So I can't talk you into a repeat performance right now?~
@2225 = ~And here I was thinking just the same thing.~
@2226 = ~No, certainly not, though I am disinclined to redraw the line between "a bit" and "too much."~
@2227 = ~Oh, certainly not that.~
@2228 = ~I don't think so, <CHARNAME>. Tonight... well, that will be another story entirely.~
@2229 = ~Oh, were you? I cannot say that I've been called a bad influence in... well, quite some time now.~
@2230 = ~But come, we accomplish little by lying here, and there are preparations to be made before we can set out for the day.~
@2231 = ~(You momentarily find your attention drawn to Isra.)~
@2232 = ~(She has been somewhat quiet recently, and she carries about her an air of distraction that would be worrying from someone less composed.)~
@2233 = ~(She notices your attention and smiles, as if to reassure you that she is quite alright. The smile takes several moments to fade again.)~
@2234 = ~(Her moods have been decidedly somber as of late, but the ghost of a smile touches her lips as she notices you watching her.)~
@2235 = ~(She reaches out as if she means to brush your arm, but catches herself at the last moment, her smile turning slightly rueful.)~
@2236 = ~(She reaches out, her fingers briefly brushing against the side of your arm in a silent, rueful gesture.)~
@2237 = ~(You find her murmuring softly under her breath, the words lilting as if they are meant to be sung to music. She smiles at you, the expression as laced with nostalgia as her voice.)~
@2238 = ~'Twas one of my sister's favorites... once upon a time. I could never do it justice, of course.~
@2239 = ~I'd love to hear it from your tongue regardless, Isra.~
@2240 = ~Are you feeling any better about things?~
@2241 = ~Perhaps we can find a bard to sing it tonight.~
@2242 = ~One day I shall have to oblige you, then, though... not just yet.~
@2243 = ~Aye, somewhat. And sometimes. Thank you, regardless.~
@2244 = ~I think I would appreciate that.~
@2245 = ~(She draws close to you, her movements quieter than one would expect from a woman in full armor. She says nothing, content merely to walk in step with you for a moment, but there is a new warmth to her smile that had not been there before.)~
@2246 = ~(Isra has always treated you considerately, but sometimes you wonder if there might be something more.)~
@2247 = ~(Isra does not normally like to touch people without permission, though this once, your backpack is in such a state of disorder that she decides to make an exception. With a slightly breathy apology, she quickly rearranges the straps that hold it in place.)~
@2248 = ~(If her fingers linger a moment longer than propriety would demand, she does not seem to notice.)~
@2249 = ~(Isra's eyes follow you for a moment, her gaze decidedly appreciative. She smiles when she sees that you've noticed, utterly unperturbed.)~
@2250 = ~(You notice Isra watching you, a thoughtful, somewhat appraising gleam in her eyes. She shakes her head ruefully, laughing lightly to herself.)~
@2251 = ~Apologies, my Lord. I was imagining you in one of the latest courtly styles. It may seem somewhat foppish to you, but there is no lady in Athkatla who would not appreciate the sight.~
@2252 = ~Apologies, my Lady. I was... well, sometimes I think it a pity there is no use for courtly dress upon the road. Though there is no lady in Athkatla you do not put to shame regardless.~
@2253 = ~(Isra seems to sense your needs almost as quickly as you do sometimes. The <DAYNIGHT>s have been warm as of late, and she silently draws beside you, offering you a slightly lopsided smile and a drink from her water bottle. Your own, you notice afterwards, is very nearly empty.)~
@2254 = ~(Isra comes to walk beside you, her step light and untroubled. She smiles, her eyes lingering upon you for a brief moment longer than necessary before she returns to scanning the surroundings for potential trouble.)~
@2255 = ~(A small smile playing across her lips, Isra approaches you, each step radiating quiet, unconscious confidence.)~
@2256 = ~(She has taken advantage of a rare peaceful moment to rebraid a portion of her plaited hair. Noticing your attention, her smile widens.)~
@2257 = ~I would leave it down for you, my Lord, but I cannot imagine that is the safest of options.~
@2258 = ~You are more than welcome to help, my Lady, if you wish it.~
@2259 = ~(She seems to sense your needs almost as quickly as you do sometimes. The <DAYNIGHT>s have been warm as of late, and as she silently draws beside you, Isra offers you a drink from her water bottle. Your own, you notice afterwards, is very nearly empty.)~
@2260 = ~(She reaches up, the back of her hand brushing against your cheek as she runs her fingers through your hair. With a soft sigh, she presses a kiss against the corner of your mouth before moving away again.)~
@2261 = ~(She reaches up, the back of her hand brushing against your cheek as she runs her fingers through your hair. She examines one lock thoughtfully, and you get the distinct impression that had you more than a moment to spare, she would start braiding it.)~
@2262 = ~(With a soft sigh, Isra presses a kiss against the corner of your mouth before moving away again.)~
@2263 = ~(She kneels down, the back of her hand brushing against your cheek as she runs her fingers through your hair. With a soft sigh, she bends down to press a kiss against the corner of your mouth before moving away again.)~

@2266 = ~(Her hands find their way to your shoulders, and with a self-satisfied sigh, she begins to give you an impromptu massage. Her fingers are deceptively strong, and it is several moments before you can find the heart to call an end to this brief break.)~
@2267 = ~(She kneels down, her hands unexpectedly finding their way to your shoulders. With a self-satisfied sigh, Isra begins to give you an impromptu massage. Her fingers are deceptively strong, and it is several moments before you can find the heart to call an end to this brief break.)~
@2268 = ~(She drops her pack to the ground for a moment to fix a broken strap on her armor, and you catch a brief glimpse of sheer red fabric in her bag... notoriously revealing Sunite ceremonial garb, most likely. She closes the bag a moment later, laughing softly in amusement.)~
@2269 = ~You are welcome to see me in it later tonight, my love.~
@2270 = ~Or out of it, mayhap.~
@2271 = ~Sometimes... usually I think it a shame that there are so few men within the Sunite Church. One such as you, <CHARNAME>...~
@2272 = ~(smile) Needless to say, I would be the envy of any number of our priestesses right now.~
@2273 = ~I have never considered myself overly conventional, you know, but it does seem in keeping with tradition that every knight must find some fair maiden to woo.~
@2274 = ~(laugh) Of course, 'tis somewhat difficult at times to determine which of us is the warrior and which the fair maid.~
@2275 = ~(She has nothing to say for the moment, but her step is light and untroubled as she walks beside you. Her eyes linger upon you for a brief moment longer than necessary before she returns to scanning the surroundings for potential trouble.)~
@2276 = ~(She takes your hand in her own for a brief moment, silently pressing her lips against your knuckles. Reluctantly, she finally releases you, turning back to the task at hand.)~
@2277 = ~No... you needn't say anything, <CHARNAME>. Not right now. I only wanted to be close for a moment.~
@2278 = ~Sometimes I wonder what the occasional, unavoidable Athkatlan social event would be like with you by my side, my love.~
@2279 = ~(smile) Somewhat more tolerable, at the least, though I would hate to expose you to the inevitable gossip.~
@2280 = ~(You have seen her curtsy before, if only when out of armor, but to<DAYNIGHT> Isra bows to you instead, the gesture perhaps slightly more flamboyant than it has to be.)~
@2281 = ~(Her smile still somewhat lopsided, she suddenly offers you her hand, clearly content to let you play the role of the gallant gentleman instead.)~
@2282 = ~(She laughs, slipping easily out of the adopted role, and takes your hand, giving it an affectionate if somewhat more casual kiss.)~
@2283 = ~Shall I beg a lock of your hair to hold close to my heart, my love? Or shall I offer one instead?~
@2284 = ~Mayhap 'twould be best to have an exchange of sorts, I think.~
@2285 = ~("Sultry" is not a word one would normally use to describe Isra, but to<DAYNIGHT> it is surprisingly fitting. It may be the rich scent of Calishite perfume, or the gleam in her eyes as she regards you, but it is definitely there.)~
@2286 = ~(She brushes her fingers against the side of your face, and if not for the demands of propriety, you guess tell that she would already be kissing you. Or more.)~
@2287 = ~(Pull her close, kissing her deeply.)~
@2288 = ~You don't exactly need to ask, you know.~
@2289 = ~(Pull away from her.)~

@2291 = ~(Isra doesn't quite melt into your arms, but comes as close as her armor allows, tangling a hand in your hair as she returns the kiss.)~
@2292 = ~(smile) Don't I? I shall have to keep that in mind, then.~
@2293 = ~(Isra barely keeps herself from overbalancing, but laughs off the near fall, tangling a hand in your hair as she returns the kiss.)~
@2294 = ~(After a moment, you see the handkerchief of pure white silk wrapped between her fingers... and the intricately designed scarlet rose embroidered upon it.)~
@2295 = ~Take it, my love. I must be allowed the occasional concession to courtly romance... even if they are somewhat backwards by necessity.~
@2296 = ~Shall I beg a kiss of you, my love? Surely we have time enough to spare for such simple pleasures?~
@2297 = ~Some of my order are taken to writing courtly poetry, you know. I am no writer, to be sure, but a gallant young man such as yourself...~
@2298 = ~(laugh) I may have it somewhat backwards, of course, and perhaps that is for the best. Were I to write a sonnet, I doubt it would even be worth listening to.~
@2299 = ~Some of my order are taken to writing courtly poetry, you know. I am no writer, to be sure, but your beauty, <CHARNAME>...~
@2300 = ~It could inspire a sonnet or two even from my lips, I think. Perhaps they would even be worth listening to.~
@2301 = ~(A thoughtful, somewhat appraising gleam appears in her eyes, and her smile grows slightly rueful.)~
@2302 = ~One day I shall need to see you in one of the latest courtly styles, my Lord. It may seem somewhat foppish to you, but there is no lady in Athkatla who would not appreciate the sight. Least of all myself.~
@2303 = ~One day I shall need to see you in Calishite silks and satins, <CHARNAME>... my own, perhaps, if I cannot convince you to buy something new. You would be beautiful in it regardless.~
@2304 = ~(Her smile soon fades into a slightly exasperated frown, and she pulls out a handkerchief, dabbing it gently across your cheek. The cloth comes back red, and she spends a moment inspecting your cheek, making certain that the blood is not yours.)~
@2305 = ~(Her smile soon fades into a slightly exasperated frown, however. She pulls out a handkerchief, and bending down, dabs it gently across your cheek. The cloth comes back red, and she spends a moment inspecting your cheek, making certain that the blood is not yours.)~
@2306 = ~One day soon, we shall need to visit a bathhouse, I think... preferably one with private facilities and no questions asked.~
@2307 = ~Take this, my love. 'Twas straight from an Ophal caravan. I hate to put gold into that family's coffers, but candies such as this... nobody in Amn makes them better.~
@2308 = ~(She does not say anything, content to merely admire you for a brief moment. It is only with a soft, somewhat regretful sigh that she turns away again.)~
@2309 = ~I did warn you not to get involved.~
@2310 = ~Did you... did you know what was going on before?~
@2311 = ~No. But I could guess. I know her better than you do now.~
@2312 = ~I can't deny that.~
@2313 = ~(sigh) This is probably the best way it could have ended, Isra. I just wish it hadn't been you.~
@2314 = ~I know. Thank you.~
@2315 = ~Well. Isn't this interesting.~
@2316 = ~I never would have guessed that my little sister might develop a taste for rogues.~
@2317 = ~I thought that you didn't believe in love on the road, Isra.~
@2318 = ~Clearly I was wrong.~
@2319 = ~Hmm. Apparently so. Well, congratulations, <CHARNAME>. And good luck. And if you ever hurt her, you'll live to regret it, of course.~
@2320 = ~Or perhaps you won't. Isra's the one who likes to play with swords, after all.~
@2321 = ~Are you quite finished?~
@2322 = ~If you absolutely insist.~
@2323 = ~Well, what a pleasant surprise. I almost thought it would be another five years before I saw you again.~
@2324 = ~It wasn't nearly that long, Alia.~
@2325 = ~You would be amazed at how time stretches out when you're wondering whether someone is dead or alive.~
@2326 = ~I...~
@2327 = ~Don't, Isra. I don't want to hear it.~
@2328 = ~We meet again. Do wonders never cease? Come to think of it, I don't think you've introduced me to your new friend... <CHARNAME>, is it?~
@2329 = ~Alia--~
@2330 = ~Oh, come now. I don't bite. Not usually, at least.~
@2331 = ~Er... nice to meet you. I think.~
@2332 = ~You're no barmaid. What exactly do you do around here?~
@2333 = ~With such beautiful daughters, your family must consider itself blessed.~
@2334 = ~As much as I hate to interrupt this... friendly sisterly reunion, we need to head off.~
@2335 = ~Enchanted, I'm sure.~
@2336 = ~No... I'm really not. I mean to open a festhall in the city at some point, and it just so happens that Patricia owes my little sister a favor or two.~
@2337 = ~She most certainly does not.~
@2338 = ~She happens to disagree. And so do I.~
@2339 = ~Oh, my. It's no wonder you keep this one around, Isra. How very charming.~
@2340 = ~<CHARNAME>, please don't encourage her.~
@2341 = ~I hardly need encouragement, I assure you.~
@2342 = ~I see. Don't be a stranger.~
@2343 = ~Well. I didn't expect to see you again quite so soon, little sister. Don't you have something gallant and heroic to do?~
@2344 = ~Must you, Alia?~
@2345 = ~I'm afraid so.~
@2346 = ~Darling, I do hope you can find a free moment sometime soon. There's this new festhall in the Wave District that I visited just last tenday--~
@2347 = ~Alia, can you truly find nothing more... worthwhile to do with your time?~
@2348 = ~Oh, shall I go hunt monsters instead? I can just imagine father's reaction to that piece of news.~
@2349 = ~So can I. Quite easily.~
@2350 = ~Yes... I suppose you can.~
@2351 = ~Really, Isra. You're making the clientele nervous with that shiny armor of yours. Is it so hard to change into something more appropriate for a tavern?~
@2352 = ~'Twould depend on whether we mean to settle down for the night yet.~
@2353 = ~Hmm. Or perhaps your new friend <CHARNAME> merely enjoys the occasional pub crawl. I can certainly say that I approve of that way of thinking.~
@2354 = ~(sigh) Yes, I suppose you do.~
@2355 = ~Mmm... this really isn't a good time, I'm afraid.~
@2356 = ~You! You're the <PRO_MANWOMAN> who got my sister killed, aren't you? She'd have likely forgiven you for that, but don't expect the same from me.~
@2357 = ~Isra... please, you know that you're not exactly welcome by this family.~
@2358 = ~I don't believe that we have any further business, <CHARNAME>.~
@2359 = ~I have no further use for you, <PRO_SIRMAAM>.~
@2360 = ~Ahh, Isra. I was hoping I would have a chance to see you.~
@2361 = ~Hello, mother. Dare I ask how Eshpurta is?~
@2362 = ~About as dull as it normally is. But if we are going to engage in small talk, I would prefer it be about something interesting.~
@2363 = ~This handsome young man must be <CHARNAME>... Alia had some interesting things to say about him.~
@2364 = ~This lovely young lady must be <CHARNAME>... Alia had some interesting things to say about her.~
@2365 = ~This must be <CHARNAME>... Alia had some interesting things to say about <PRO_HIMHER>.~
@2366 = ~(sigh) I can believe it.~
@2367 = ~I assure you, dear, she was relatively polite about it.~
@2368 = ~It's a pleasure to finally meet you, <CHARNAME>. I hope I can trust you to curb some of my daughter's more reckless tendencies?~
@2369 = ~I'm trying my hardest, my lady.~
@2370 = ~She isn't quite as bad as that.~
@2371 = ~A bit of recklessness is in the job description, I'm afraid.~
@2372 = ~That is certainly encouraging.~
@2373 = ~Then you apparently do not know her like I do.~
@2374 = ~Yes... I'm afraid that may be the case.~
@2375 = ~Mother... is this truly necessary?~
@2376 = ~I'm sorry, Isra. I have too much to worry about right now as it is.~
@2377 = ~With Rana, I know. Do you have any news?~
@2378 = ~Not yet. I'm meeting with Lady Lamia in an hour to discuss the situation. I suggest you not worry about it overmuch, Isra. Or blame yourself for it.~
@2379 = ~I don't, I assure you.~
@2380 = ~Hmm. Very well.~
@2381 = ~I do wish you'd gotten here somewhat earlier, Isra. I really do have to run now, but it really has been lovely to see you. Both of you.~
@2382 = ~Aye, of course. Safe journeys, mother.~
@2383 = ~And to you as well.~
@2384 = ~I have nothing to say to you, <SIRMAAM>.~
@2385 = ~Ah, gentle lady, your beauty sets my very soul afire!~
@2386 = ~Does it, now? That does not sound terribly healthy.~
@2387 = ~But what is health next to such sublime loveliness, my sweet? I would give half the years of my life for even a night in your arms.~
@2388 = ~You should consider yourself fortunate that I'm no succubus to take advantage of that sentiment.~
@2389 = ~I shall count myself fortunate when you deign to take me to your bed, my dusky beauty, and not a moment before.~
@2390 = ~That may prove rather inconvenient for you.~
@2391 = ~And none of it pleasant, by the sound of it.~
@2392 = ~Man and beast... I doubt that this is legal, <CHARNAME>. I can only hope that the participants are consenting.~
@2393 = ~You would allow this... this savagery to continue, <CHARNAME>? I didn't think you so cold.~
@2394 = ~More of the beasts? That does not surprise me. Mayhap we can pay them a visit as well.~
@2395 = ~That would be appreciated.~
@2396 = ~Help us, please! We beg you!~
@2397 = ~This is... abominable, <CHARNAME>! We must help these people!~
@2398 = ~There once was a lady so classy,
all thought her an elegant lassie.
Although she's tight-lipped,
if ever she slipped,
you'd learn that she's so very sassy.~
@2399 = ~Really, must we listen to this?~
@2400 = ~If we are quite done here, I have already heard far more than I might have liked.~
@2401 = ~<CHARNAME>, I suggest we do not make a habit of such... associations.~
@2402 = ~Steal from the Lathandrites? Even were it not an allied faith, I would have no taste for such... work. Nor will I be involved. Mayhap we shall meet again, <CHARNAME>.~
@2403 = ~As little love as I have for the church of Talos, I very much hope that we won't make a habit of this.~
@2404 = ~I do not like this, <CHARNAME>. Even if the victim is a Shadow Thief as well, I have no wish to harm him without knowing his crime.~
@2405 = ~By Sune, I had hoped that we had seen the last of this wretched man on the Sword Coast. I would almost rather be speaking with Mae'Var again instead.~
@2406 = ~The sentiment is mutual, paladin, I assure you.~
@2407 = ~"Not necessarily", he says.~
@2408 = ~I can only hope that you've learned something from this unfortunate affair.~
@2409 = ~More than I could say, milady.~
@2410 = ~Have you no appreciation for compassion whatsoever, Anomen?~
@2411 = ~Pfeh! Compassion should not be wasted upon such filth, Sunite.~
@2412 = ~By the loss of your people or your contraband?~
@2413 = ~Your insinuation is unwarranted. I care about my people, whatever you might think on the matter.~
@2414 = ~A surprisingly worthwhile end to this alliance.~
@2415 = ~'Twas a kind thing to do, <CHARNAME>.~
@2416 = ~Poverty does not make a soul barren, Anomen. You have lived in Athkatla long enough to understand that.~
@2417 = ~I will not be lectured by the likes of you, woman.~
@2418 = ~What mad blasphemy is this!?~
@2419 = ~'Twas a god once, when the world was still young, mayhap. Strange, the things that can be lost to time.~
@2420 = ~A hurricane has no mind, Talossan. The man who would relish such destruction is another matter entirely.~
@2421 = ~Well met, Lady Isra! I have heard that congratulations are in order?~
@2422 = ~(laugh) Word travels fast, I see. Thank you, Alvanna.~
@2423 = ~The Ruby Rose should be proud to have you. And you are, of course, as welcome in the house of the Morninglord as you have ever been.~
@2424 = ~I would never have thought otherwise, my friend.~
@2425 = ~<CHARNAME>, have you no use whatsoever for respect? We have been sent by the Church of Helm to investigate matters, sir.~
@2426 = ~Then our quests are linked. I am a humble servant of the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart, and I believe I am to meet you here.~
@2427 = ~<CHARNAME>, have you no use whatsoever for respect? We have been sent by the Church of Lathander to investigate matters, sir.~
@2428 = ~As terrible a thought as any.~
@2429 = ~<CHARNAME>... don't speak these words.~
@2430 = ~Decidedly strange company for a Talossan in any case, though odder things have happened.~
@2431 = ~Why, if it isn't the Lady Isra. There's still no temple to Sune here, I'm afraid, though if you ask real nice, maybe they'll build you one.~
@2432 = ~Your mockery is unappreciated, sir.~
@2433 = ~Loath as I am to intrude upon an official investigation, Athkatla's forces have seemed rather... beleaguered as of late. Perhaps we should look into this, <CHARNAME>.~
@2434 = ~By Sune, this is... not as I had remembered the playhouse.~
@2435 = ~I would lend these people aid, <CHARNAME>. Too few defend the cares of bards in this city as it is.~
@2436 = ~'Twould be a kinder city if they did, my child.~
@2437 = ~What madness is this, <CHARNAME>? You agreed to help these people!~
@2438 = ~Ain't ye a bit too old to be playing knight in shining armor, lassie? Ye ought to settle down nice and proper!~
@2439 = ~This is hardly a game to me, my lady, but I thank you for your advice... unsolicited though it may have been.~
@2440 = ~Lady Isra! Why, it is a pleasure to see you, as always. How fares your cousin Lamia? I haven't seen her in ages!~
@2441 = ~Lady Crytrapper is quite well, thank you, though I am beginning to understand why she avoids Athkatla. If you would please excuse me.~
@2442 = ~You there! Yer a Sunite, by the looks of ye. Ain't ye got nothing better to do than prance around with them actors and such?~
@2443 = ~More often than not, aye.~
@2444 = ~Hmph. I'll believe it when I sees it.~
@2445 = ~Looking like ye does, my dear, ye could make a nice penny on the streets yourself. Far better than getting yerself skewered in some dungeon, at least.~
@2446 = ~(sigh) I am not sure whether to be flattered or offended.~
@2447 = ~Anomen, you... why would you do such a vile thing!?~
@2448 = ~Hullo, Miss Isra. I hadn't realized ye was still in Athkatla... never thought the place agreed with ye that much.~
@2449 = ~I cannot say that it does, though I expect that business will keep me here for the foreseeable future.~
@2450 = ~Is that so? Well, ye should drop by more often, milady. Yer a far cry from me normal clientele.~
@2451 = ~(laugh) I'm afraid I tend to frighten that normal clientele away.~
@2452 = ~I ain't got no problem with that, I assure ye.~
@2453 = ~Oh, not this again.~
@2454 = ~Why, if it isn't the lady Isra! I do hope your order is treating you well these days.~
@2455 = ~Quite well, thank you.~
@2456 = ~Very good, very good. Well, if that ever changes, don't ever think that you have nowhere else to go.~
@2457 = ~I see. I shall... keep that in mind, my lord.~
@2458 = ~Isra, darling, what a delight it is to see you. I hope I can expect your cousin Evendur at my next dinner party?~
@2459 = ~I think it... unlikely, my lady. He has not been well as of late.~
@2460 = ~Oh? That is a pity. We've so missed his handsome face.~
@2461 = ~This is not justice, <CHARNAME>. These men are no nobler than their victim... not if they are invoking Beshaba's name.~
@2462 = ~I would be reluctant to agree to any task blindly, <CHARNAME>... especially one proposed by a Cowled Wizard.~
@2463 = ~Must you be so heartless, <CHARNAME>?~
@2464 = ~The nobility's favor is fickler than a church's, sir. Your art will not be immortalized if you refuse such commissions.~
@2465 = ~Your prejudices are certainly plain enough to see, milady.~
@2466 = ~One moment, my lady... you are related to the Jysstevs, are you not? There are some tax irregularities that I would like to have a word about.~
@2467 = ~Then mayhap you should speak with the Jysstevs themselves.~
@2468 = ~Well, I would... if they'd talk to me.~
@2469 = ~Why, if it isn't Miss Isra Ghadir... your father still hasn't managed to marry you off, has he?~
@2470 = ~Ah... no, he has not.~
@2471 = ~For shame. I do have a nephew who might make for an appropriate match--~
@2472 = ~That is... kind of you, my lady, but truly unnecessary.~
@2473 = ~Hmm... I remember you, girl. Didn't your mother run off with a commoner or some such nonsense?~
@2474 = ~My mother's house is more impressed by success than by blood, my lord. Would that all of Amn's nobility was as sensible.~
@2475 = ~You do not know them as well as you think you do, if that is the case.~
@2476 = ~Darling, a young thing like you... you could do quite well for yourself here if you learned to bend a little.~
@2477 = ~I would have thought that you didn't care for competition.~
@2478 = ~Oh, there is more than enough favor to go around.~
@2479 = ~Of that I have no doubt.~
@2480 = ~Extortion and worse... what do you know of these people, friend?~
@2481 = ~N-not much, I'm afraid.~
@2482 = ~I do not like this, <CHARNAME>. This... woman... positively reeks of evil. Don't make the mistake of treating with her!~
@2483 = ~You cannot possibly be considering this offer, <CHARNAME>. I certainly won't work with this creature.~
@2484 = ~This is madness, <CHARNAME>! I thought-- clearly I was wrong. I wish you luck; you will likely need it.~
@2485 = ~Surely we can do something for the child, <CHARNAME>.~
@2486 = ~The Copper Coronet... 'tis little surprise that it counts even murderers amongst its patrons.~
@2487 = ~Important? Love should not be about feeling important, my lady.~
@2488 = ~Oh, don't be such a spoilsport.~
@2489 = ~Crimes? Oh, <CHARNAME>...~
@2490 = ~Comfortable, mayhap, though I've spent enough time in stables to be wary of the smell.~
@2491 = ~You'd get used to it quick enough.~
@2492 = ~You are prouder than you realize, child, and more obstinate. Don't judge those closest to you more harshly than you would a stranger. They don't deserve it.~
@2493 = ~Words to take to heart. Thank you, my lady.~
@2494 = ~My, that should be a lovely sight. I do wonder what sculptor they commissioned for this.~
@2495 = ~We cannot leave her like this, <CHARNAME>. If there is a way to restore her, money is of little consequence.~
@2496 = ~Help me, please!~
@2497 = ~Rejiek...? There cannot possibly be *two* fiends in Amn with that name.~
@2498 = ~I did not realize that one had to found a city to be considered nobility.~
@2499 = ~Hmph. True nobility, I said.~
@2500 = ~Commoner? I doubt the Lurraxols of Murann would appreciate their kinswoman being called common.~
@2501 = ~What the fools in Murann think is of little consequence here.~
@2502 = ~Swords and ale are hardly the markings of an adult.~
@2503 = ~But you've got one, lady!~
@2504 = ~Loath as I am to credit old wives' tales, I have never heard of wolves or ogres doing such things... we should step carefully, <CHARNAME>.~
@2505 = ~I can sense no evil in this woman, <CHARNAME>. There is no need to leave her here. Come, I shall free her myself.~
@2506 = ~I would trust this man far sooner than I would the wizards, <CHARNAME>.~
@2507 = ~The wizards have played us for fools, <CHARNAME>. I would not harm this man on their behalf.~
@2508 = ~If you mean to fight this ranger, <CHARNAME>, you shall do it without my aid.~
@2509 = ~Have at you!~
@2510 = ~Do reconsider, <CHARNAME>. I have no wish to come into conflict with the Radiant Heart.~
@2511 = ~I... see. I have no wish to come into conflict with the Radiant Heart.~
@2512 = ~We should make haste, <CHARNAME>. I would not trust his child's wellbeing in Lord Jierdan's hands for long.~
@2513 = ~You would leave this creature unchallenged, <CHARNAME>? Garren's child is our priority at the moment, but I would be wary of giving this beast a chance to regroup.~
@2514 = ~Dragons are seldom so indulgent, <CHARNAME>... if he wishes us to leave, it is likely because he is not as prepared as he thought he was. I would call his bluff.~
@2515 = ~And you are welcome to, paladin, if you are so eager to die.~
@2516 = ~This is no time for such jests, <CHARNAME>. I, for one, will tolerate no deals with this beast.~
@2517 = ~This is madness, <CHARNAME>, and I shan't stand for it!~
@2518 = ~How needlessly tragic this <DAYNIGHT> has been... we must at least try to save his lady, <CHARNAME>, and I would have words with the one who ordered this in any case.~
@2519 = ~Justice will not be served until this Galvena has been brought low as well.~
@2520 = ~By Sune, this tale grows darker with each passing moment.~
@2521 = ~By Sune, what has been done to her...?~
@2522 = ~This truly is a place of madness.~
@2523 = ~The line between a gift and a curse... 'tis terrible to behold.~
@2524 = ~You win little sympathy from me if all you can think to criticize is how poorly you have been paid!~
@2525 = ~<CHARNAME>! I would sooner leave myself than abandon her here.~
@2526 = ~<CHARNAME>? <CHARNAME>, are you well? You look faint.~
@2527 = ~I feel a bit faint too. Don't worry about it.~
@2528 = ~I wasn't fully in control for a moment, but... I'm okay now.~
@2529 = ~It's nothing, Isra. Let's move on.~
@2530 = ~Very well, but... if you are hurt, you will let me know, I hope.~
@2531 = ~<CHARNAME>, you... that was an avatar of Bhaal! Whatever madness caused such a thing, you must guard against it happening again!~
@2532 = ~<CHARNAME>? <CHARNAME>, 'tis a nightmare, surely. You must--~
@2533 = ~I think it's happening again! Stay away!~
@2534 = ~Stand back, Isra! I cannot control this!~
@2535 = ~Don't touch me right now, woman! I...~
@2536 = ~Your lips move, but I don't... <CHARNAME>? <CHARNAME>, do you hear-- no!~
@2537 = ~<CHARNAME>, you would have killed me, had I let you. I...~
@2538 = ~'Twould be wiser to sleep apart, I think... at least for a time. Though I rather doubt that I shall be sleeping well at all in the near future.~
@2539 = ~Saviors...? I can think of few things I would like to do less.~
@2540 = ~By the gods, it actually wants to talk?~
@2541 = ~How... utterly charming a tone.~
@2542 = ~Outside of dreaming? I do not care for the sound of this.~
@2543 = ~I cannot imagine that anyone would ask you to.~
@2544 = ~What a majestic creature this is... 'tis a blessing even to lay eyes upon her.~
@2545 = ~Yes, yes, of course, but I have little time for your starry-eyed fawning. Listen well to what I say.~
@2546 = ~Massacring svirfneblin... surely there are more worthwhile uses of our time.~
@2547 = ~Your time will be spent as I deem fit, female.~
@2548 = ~My companion, Isra.~
@2549 = ~(snort) The female who fights by your side? What do I care if you dally with her? But I shall have her executed before I allow you to choose her over me.~
@2550 = ~Well, alright, it's not her... it's, uh, someone else you don't know...~
@2551 = ~But I still can't do this, Phaere...~
@2552 = ~Well, perhaps it's not someone... it's, ah, a more personal problem...~
@2553 = ~Very well.  I suppose I have no choice, here.~
@2554 = ~You follow in the hopes of retrieving something dear to you. I say that the longer you keep this up, the more you will lose.~
@2555 = ~Consider the lovely Isra here. Some tales are too tragic even for a Sunite's tastes.~
@2556 = ~I don't fear you, vampire.~
@2557 = ~Oh, but you should. Follow me further, <CHARNAME>, and you will lose more than you can imagine!  Starting now!~
@2558 = ~The Final Battle with Bodhi.

Bodhi appeared in an ambush shortly before I reached her haven, warning me that she was aware of my pursuit and stealing from me the one person that is dearest to my heart: Isra.  Before she vanished and unleashed more of her undead creations upon me, Bodhi warned me that if I continue I will lose even more than I thought possible.  I cannot give up on the Rhynn Lanthorn... but now the life and immortal soul of the one I love is at stake, as well!~
@2559 = ~A friend is afflicted by vampirism.  An old book suggested that followers of Oghma might know something about that.~
@2560 = ~I lost a loved one in a battle with his sister, Bodhi.  I seek a means of curing her.~
@2561 = ~Have you come seeking wisdom from the Binder of What is Known? The Wise God stands ready.~
@2562 = ~No, thank you, I have no need of help at the moment.~
@2563 = ~Elhan! I've the half vampire body of Isra here because of you! You'll tell me now!~
@2564 = ~A loved one was taken by a vampire. What can I expect when I find her?~
@2565 = ~Someone I care about has fallen to a vampire. Is there any way to save her?~
@2566 = ~But... no, I have already prepared much for this meeting, <CHARNAME>. I did warn you that you would suffer great loss if you continued your push towards me.  I did not lie.~
@2567 = ~You have taken too much already!  You will return both Imoen's soul and Isra!~
@2568 = ~And you have delivered on that promise. Return Isra and perhaps I will be merciful.~
@2569 = ~I would have hunted you for your theft of Isra alone. She is very important to me.~
@2570 = ~You place too much confidence in sentiment.  The theft of Isra will not save you.~
@2571 = ~Here she is, though she is lost to you. They say that nothing is more vile than a fallen paladin, and it may yet prove true. I doubt your fumbling could have inspired the loyalty I have taken with a bite and a gaze.~
@2572 = ~The Final Battle with Bodhi.

Bodhi has turned Isra into a vampire!  Or... or very nearly.  The process may not have been completed in the short time Bodhi has had her. I will have lost her if something cannot be done.  Perhaps the elven war sage might know some way of restoration ... or Elhan...~
@2573 = ~An interesting ploy, though I am sure her fate will still serve as an example, whether you wish her back or not.~
@2574 = ~Do you see that, <CHARNAME>? She is not yet fully turned, and yet she is already mine to use against you. So much for true love.~
@2575 = ~What... do you wish of me, mistress?~
@2576 = ~Gone...? Destroyed? I thought... I had assumed that there would still be time.~
@2577 = ~Aye, such an overture would be greeted with suspicion at best, though any aid would still be appreciated.~
@2578 = ~We shall prove more resourceful by far in destroying you, vampire!~
@2579 = ~Aye, were it easy, the city would already be saved.~
@2580 = ~Oh, has victory ever been as glorious as this, or as dearly bought...~
@2581 = ~Isra, the paladin of Sune who has worked her way into your own heart. Recent events have proven painful and difficult for both of you, but you can find no trace of regret in her eyes as she gazes at you now.~
@2582 = ~Isra... I ---~
@2583 = ~Isra, the paladin of Sune, has been a steadfast friend and companion thus far, but she has a life of her own outside of your struggles.~
@2584 = ~Isra... you have family to return to. You don't need to follow me; this isn't your fight.~
@2585 = ~Irenicus is a dangerous enemy, Isra. Don't feel like you have to go through with this.~
@2586 = ~I hope you're ready for what lies ahead, Isra. I need you at your best.~
@2587 = ~Don't, <CHARNAME>. Please. If you were to start speaking now, I'm not sure I could ever bring myself to stop you. We haven't the time for that.~
@2588 = ~You know that I would never turn back now, not when this entire city is depending upon us. But even if it were just you in danger, that would be enough.~
@2589 = ~Should I abandon you now, my friend, at the very end? I would never be able to live with myself. Come, let us meet your wizard one final time.~
@2590 = ~Aye, I know it. Come, let us meet your wizard one final time.~
@2591 = ~By all the gods, I did not think it would be finished quite so easily, though the Nine Hells... I can only pray that this is just temporary.~ [rh#is153]
@2592 = ~In Sune's name, wizard, your depravities stop here!~ [rh#is154]
@2593 = ~I would hesitate to speak right now, <CHARNAME>. Too many distractions may well prove deadly.~
@2594 = ~There's something wrong with your voice, Isra.~
@2595 = ~Of course.~
@2596 = ~Yes, what is it?~ [rh#is024]
@2597 = ~I'm ready to visit the Crytrapper estate now.~
@2598 = ~What do you think of our quest?~
@2599 = ~Could I ask you something personal?~
@2600 = ~Could you tell me about your religion?~
@2601 = ~I'd like to talk to you for a moment, Isra.~
@2602 = ~Is there something wrong with your voice?~
@2603 = ~(Flirt with Isra)~
@2604 = ~Not at the moment.~
@2605 = ~Good. I'm relieved to hear it.~
@2606 = ~I must admit, I find the thought of asking the Shadow Thieves for aid repugnant, but I see little alternative at the moment.~
@2607 = ~Were the tasks we've been assigned not so important, I would be more troubled about the deal we have made.~
@2608 = ~I am beginning to worry that if we do not finish these tasks and find Imoen quickly, it may already be too late.~
@2609 = ~I think we need to find out way out of here as quickly as possible.~
@2610 = ~I cannot say that I am terribly fond of it right now. I only wonder what we will find at the end of it.~
@2611 = ~I think slaying a vampire is always a worthy goal... especially one as powerful and horrific as Bodhi.~
@2612 = ~I cannot say that I am terribly fond of it right now.~
@2613 = ~I think we ought to find Irenicus as quickly as possible.~
@2614 = ~I... truly, I wish we had had a chance to see Suldanessellar when it was still in its glory... not like this.~
@2615 = ~You can certainly ask. I do not promise to answer, of course.~
@2616 = ~You don't have any other sisters I have to worry about, I hope.~
@2617 = ~You and your sister's husband don't seem to get along very well.~
@2618 = ~Why do you dislike the Jysstevs so much?~
@2619 = ~Does your whole family worship Sune?~
@2620 = ~You're affiliated with a major merchant family. What does your family trade in?~
@2621 = ~So that was your mentor. I'm not sure what I was expecting.~
@2622 = ~Do you have any hobbies? Aside from slaying dragons, that is.~
@2623 = ~You're a Sunite. Have you ever been in love before?~
@2624 = ~I wanted to know more about your old flame in Crimmor.~
@2625 = ~Could you tell me what was your first kiss like?~
@2626 = ~Are all Sunite paladins so beautiful, or are you exceptionally blessed?~
@2627 = ~What's your favorite color?~
@2628 = ~What is Crimmor like?~
@2629 = ~What were you like as a child?~
@2630 = ~Do you have any favorite taverns?~
@2631 = ~I wouldn't have expected a paladin to be so comfortable in the Den of the Seven Vales.~
@2632 = ~I take it you could give me the tour of Athkatla's festhalls?~
@2633 = ~What do you think about our companions?~
@2634 = ~Actually, never mind.~
@2635 = ~No, just the two, though I have more cousins than I can count.~
@2636 = ~No, we never have. This recent madness with Rana hardly helps matters.~
@2637 = ~Do you blame him for it?~
@2638 = ~Do you have any idea what's going on?~
@2639 = ~I see.~
@2640 = ~I have no evidence, <CHARNAME>, and I am loath to make accusations without it. But... I do have suspicions, aye.~
@2641 = ~I have suspicions, but without actually evidence, I would sooner not share them.~
@2642 = ~(sigh) There are only a handful of truly powerful families in Amn, <CHARNAME>. Very few of them won their wealth legitimately.~
@2643 = ~You must hate half of Athkatla, in that case.~
@2644 = ~What sorts of things do the Jysstevs do?~
@2645 = ~Well, you would certainly know a thing or two about that.~
@2646 = ~That is a stronger word than I might use, though I will admit, I am seldom impressed.~
@2647 = ~Aside from endorsing foreign tyrants? I... could not say, truly. All I know is rumor, and I am reluctant to spread such gossip further without actual evidence.~
@2648 = ~... I am not in the mood for recriminations, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.~
@2649 = ~No. My father has always worshipped the Red Knight. Mother is a Sunite, and my sisters and I were raised in her faith as well, though Alia recently entered the Sharessan clergy instead.~
@2650 = ~Our relationship was complicated enough beforehand, but now... well, I'm sure that you've seen it for yourself.~
@2651 = ~Traditionally we all but control the Amnian fur trade, though there are a handful of Crytrappers involved in other affairs. My own mother prefers collecting and selling antiques. Given her bardic sympathies, that is not terribly surprising.~
@2652 = ~(sigh) He is as recovered as I expect him to ever be, but... his moods can be somewhat unpredictable at times. I... think he was too concerned about me to worry about his own predicament, however.~
@2653 = ~(laugh) Aye, I should certainly hope so. I was never as musically talented as I would have liked, unfortunately, though I obviously enjoy listening. My Lliiran friends forced me to learn how to dance as well... I should like to think that I am somewhat better at that.~
@2654 = ~I've heard Haer'dalis coax a song out of you before. You're not bad at all.~
@2655 = ~I'll need to coax a song out of you one day. I doubt you're as bad as that.~
@2656 = ~Do you have any hobbies that don't come with being a Sunite?~
@2657 = ~You can dance? I would like to see that someday.~
@2658 = ~No painting or poetry? That seems a bit like you also.~
@2659 = ~Mayhap not, but I am no bard. I don't like to pretend otherwise.~
@2660 = ~Oh. Well... yes, actually. I used to spend some time in my family's stables in Crimmor also... my mentor thought there were valuable lessons to impart there.~
@2661 = ~He was considerably less pleased with my passion for racing the poor steeds across the countryside, of course, but he never did break me of that entirely.~
@2662 = ~Hopefully there will be time for it eventually.~
@2663 = ~Mmm... tonight, mayhap. I would enjoy that as well.~
@2664 = ~I'm afraid I haven't the patience for art. Or the time for it, truly. And poetry... I don't care as much for words without melody.~
@2665 = ~Twice, aye. I love easily enough, though this life does not make such things simple.~
@2666 = ~(smile) You are not my first, <CHARNAME>. There have been others... two in particular, a priestess of Lliira and a... well, a mistake, as it so happens. I love easily enough, but this life does not make such things simple.~
@2667 = ~Mairen? What more would you know of her?~
@2668 = ~You said that she was engaged?~
@2669 = ~She's a Lliiran, not a Sunite?~
@2670 = ~How did you two meet?~
@2671 = ~She is, aye, to a merchant who came with the caravans and never quite left again afterward. I wish them only happiness.~
@2672 = ~Aye, the heart seldom draws distinctions between faiths, and there is a great deal of overlap between ours anyway.~
@2673 = ~'Tis somewhat embarrassing, I'm afraid. At the end of each caravan season in Crimmor, our churches traditionally throw a party. An exceptionally wild party, at that.~
@2674 = ~I had never been permitted to attend one before, but the summer after I turned fifteen, my mentor relented. I think he wished afterwards that he did not.~
@2675 = ~I do not drink at all now if I can help it, but then... I didn't know what I was doing. I didn't realize precisely what effect it would have upon me.~
@2676 = ~Mia found me before I could make a fool of myself, fortunately. Had she not, I would likely have woken in the bed of someone considerably less conscientious.~
@2677 = ~Please don't share that story, <CHARNAME>. I trust you with it, but I would not wish to see it spread.~
@2678 = ~What's to spread? It doesn't sound like anything happened.~
@2679 = ~You needn't fear for your honor. I would never repeat it.~
@2680 = ~If that's what alcohol does to you, I'd love to see you drunk someday.~
@2681 = ~It did not, though truth matters little where gossip is concerned.~
@2682 = ~Thank you. I did not think that you would.~
@2683 = ~I am amorous enough without it, I assure you.~
@2684 = ~(laugh) He was the son of a merchant from Cormyr who passed through Crimmor the summer I was fourteen. There is little enough to say about it, though. I never did see him again.~
@2685 = ~(laugh) Truth be told, I think it a divine gift, as much as any of our more direct powers. Nobody is vulgar enough to ask, of course, but... well, I was no great beauty as a child.~
@2686 = ~(laugh) I am going to have to be terribly predictable and say red, I'm afraid. 'Twould have to be by now, even if it was not originally.~
@2687 = ~Lovely, truly, though it can grow slightly loud during caravan season. It may well be that every caravan in Faerun passes through the city at some point... some people certainly claim as much.~
@2688 = ~The mayor is a good man, supported by equally good people, and the faiths of Sune, Lliira, Milil, and Chauntea hold sway above others. Whether Crimmor's prosperity is due to good leadership or caring religions, I could not say. Mayhap some combination of the two.~
@2689 = ~There is very little crime -- some say that the Shadow Thieves owe a favor to my mother's family and have forbidden thievery within the city. I... cannot say that I care for the implications, but the evidence is clear enough.~
@2690 = ~Not everybody within Crimmor is pleasant, of course, and there have been Athkatlan powers who have tried to increase their influence within the city. The Ophals, for one. So far to relatively little success, and I pray it remains that way.~
@2691 = ~I was quite mad, I'm afraid. Many would say that I'm still half mad, I am sure, but I've developed at least some sense of self-preservation in the intervening years.~
@2692 = ~Unbelievably gullible at times. And very nearly uncontrollable, I'm afraid, before my father managed to instill a sense of discipline in me. I'm not certain how my tutors managed to keep me alive.~
@2693 = ~After I first heard my calling, I used to have a terrible habit of slipping away from my tutors to follow soldiers around Eshpurta. Were I not a general's daughter, that would likely have ended... poorly.~
@2694 = ~In Crimmor? I'm sure I took more for granted than I should have, being related to the family that all but ruled the city, but... exhausting, I think, is the way that I would describe those years.~
@2695 = ~In Athkatla? The Five Flagons, I think, though the Hamstrung Giant back in Eshpurta... my arguments with my father are sometimes so bad that I tend to live there instead whenever I visit home.~
@2696 = ~'Tis a lovely tavern, though, frequented mostly by soldiers, merchants, and artists. In Eshpurta, the combination works beautiful. In Athkatla, 'twould probably lead to a riot.~
@2697 = ~(laugh) I do not particularly care for the clientele, but I've known Patricia for quite some time. The Lathandrites recommended the Mithrest Inn to me once several years ago, and I... clearly I didn't follow their directions as well as I could have.~
@2698 = ~You must have realized as soon as you stepped in.~
@2699 = ~You really have absolutely no sense of direction, do you?~
@2700 = ~Does Patricia give you discounts for chasing away her clientele or something?~
@2701 = ~I did, though I also realized that some of their dancers were actually quite good. Untrained and wasting their talent on lechers who could never truly appreciate it, true, but talent like that... 'twould have been a crime not to introduce them to instructors in Crimmor.~
@2702 = ~It took no small amount of effort to convince them, of course, but I can be patient when necessary.~
@2703 = ~Not as much of one as I would like, unfortunately.~
@2704 = ~Ah... no. I would never let her. I stayed at first because some of their dancers were actually quite good. Untrained and wasting their talent on lechers who could never truly appreciate it, but talent like that... 'twould have been a crime not to introduce them to instructors in Crimmor.~
@2705 = ~No. When I come to Athkatla, 'tis never in pursuit of pleasure. Mayhap you should ask my sister Alia instead... I am sure she has catalogued every establishment in the city by now.~
@2706 = ~'Twould depend upon the person in question.~
@2707 = ~Aerie?~
@2708 = ~Anomen?~
@2709 = ~Cernd?~
@2710 = ~Edwin?~
@2711 = ~Haer'dalis?~
@2712 = ~Imoen?~
@2713 = ~Jaheira?~
@2714 = ~Jan?~
@2715 = ~Keldorn?~
@2716 = ~Korgan?~
@2717 = ~Mazzy?~
@2718 = ~Minsc?~
@2719 = ~Nalia?~
@2720 = ~Neera?~
@2721 = ~Rasaad?~
@2722 = ~Viconia?~
@2723 = ~Valygar?~
@2724 = ~Yoshimo?~
@2725 = ~I wish she were more confident, but such things take time. I do enjoy her company.~
@2726 = ~He... I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>, but he reminds me of someone I once knew. The comparison is not fair to him.~
@2727 = ~I cannot say that I understand him.~
@2728 = ~Anything I have to say concerning him, my <PRO_LADYLORD>, I shall say to his face.~
@2729 = ~(laugh) He is far too charming for me to be impartial, I'm afraid, though his strange philosophy... I am not sure I care for it at all.~
@2730 = ~I... hate to see her suffering so, though 'tis truly a wonder that she is still as sane as she is.~
@2731 = ~I have nothing but respect for her, though I suppose that may be difficult to tell at times.~
@2732 = ~I am still not sure what to make of him.~
@2733 = ~My father fought alongside him once, you know. That makes things... somewhat strange, though 'tis no less of an honor.~
@2734 = ~I do not see why we need his company, <CHARNAME>.~
@2735 = ~She has a purer heart than many a paladin... and I dare say that probably includes myself. 'Twould be an understatement to say that I valued her company.~
@2736 = ~His heart is truer than most.~
@2737 = ~I never can tell whether she sees me as an ally or an enemy, but I sympathize with her regardless. I wish all of Amn's nobility were of like mind.~
@2738 = ~I have no great love for wild magic, though she herself is pleasant enough company.~
@2739 = ~I have nothing but respect for both him and his faith. I do appreciate his company.~
@2740 = ~I think he is very lonely, <CHARNAME>. Lonelier than he will admit to.~
@2741 = ~The Sharran? I prefer her where I can see her, but I must warn you never to trust a word that she says.~
@2742 = ~I know his skillset is important, but... I must admit, I do not overly care for his familiarity with the Shadow Thieves.~
@2743 = ~I would be happy to, of course. What would you care to know?~
@2744 = ~I don't know that much about Sune.~
@2745 = ~I didn't know there were paladin orders other than the Radiant Heart.~
@2746 = ~Could you tell me about your novitiate?~
@2747 = ~What is your church like?~
@2748 = ~Aye, her worship is not nearly as widespread further north as it is here. Sune is the fairest of the gods: beautiful, passionate, and boundlessly loving. She cares for her followers on a level that is somewhat unusual for a deity, mayhap, and asks only the same in return.~
@2749 = ~Isn't she a strange choice for a paladin?~
@2750 = ~Could you tell me her dogma?~
@2751 = ~Do you need to be beautiful to worship her?~
@2752 = ~Is she very popular in Amn?~
@2753 = ~I do not think so, though others might disagree. We define our devotions to our gods in so many different ways, but at heart... 'tis based either in love or fear, I believe. I have no use for the latter.~
@2754 = ~She asks us to encourage love and beauty, in ourselves, in others, and in the world at large. What exactly that means... there are as many interpretations of beauty as there are Sunites, I think. We all believe that beauty is more than skin deep, that the imprint of one's soul can be seen in one's features. Some take this to literal extremes, 'tis true, but I have always felt that external beauty is marred by a poor temper or evil intent.~
@2755 = ~We cherish art and do whatever we can to sponsor and protect its creators, and we dislike it when people hide themselves, their skills, or their treasures away. Beauty that is concealed does little to enrich Faerun in its entirety, nor does it truly even benefit its possessor. Enriching one another's lives... aye, for me, that is the key to understanding the Firehair's dogma, though others, even amongst the faithful, may well interpret it differently.~
@2756 = ~Yes and no, I would say. There is more to beauty than mere flesh, though we are all expected to cultivate our appearances to the best of our abilities. But no, nobody with love in their heart would be turned from her worship.~
@2757 = ~Exceedingly so, yes, though... not entirely for the reasons I would like, I admit.~
@2758 = ~A small handful, certainly. Sune, Lathander, and Milil each sponsor orders, though none are as large or well-organized as the Radiant Heart.~
@2759 = ~You never considered Torm or Tyr instead?~
@2760 = ~Would the Radiant Heart turn people away on religious grounds?~
@2761 = ~Milil? The god of poetry?~
@2762 = ~Those are all allied churches, aren't they?~
@2763 = ~The Ruby Rose won't be angry with you for wandering around unsupervised?~
@2764 = ~No. Their faiths do important work, but duty and justice, without anything else behind them... I could never serve that.~
@2765 = ~Not explicitly, I do not think, though 'twould be somewhat difficult for a member of a different faith to find patronage.~
@2766 = ~Aye. Most songs concerning knights are inspired by those of his order... they tend to prefer to travel with bards, and seldom simply for the pleasure of their company.~
@2767 = ~Aye. 'Tis why I know more about them. Lathander, Milil, Lliira, Selûne, Sharess, and several deities amongst the elven pantheon as well, though I am somewhat less familiar with the Seldarine.~
@2768 = ~Were I still a squire, they would be, but we are largely permitted a degree of freedom in choosing our missions. The tenets of our faith very nearly mandate such flexibility.~
@2769 = ~'Twas... trying at times, mayhap, but ultimately rewarding. I was twelve when I was entrusted to the Order of the Ruby Rose, and I had already spent several years studying under Eshpurta's finest military instructors, so weapons training was nothing out of the ordinary for me. As for religious training... in the church of Sune, 'tis more an endeavor of love than a chore.~
@2770 = ~Was it different than it would have been in another order?~
@2771 = ~What was your actual squiredom like?~
@2772 = ~Did they teach you to talk like that too?~
@2773 = ~How cloistered was it?~
@2774 = ~I should think so, aye. Discipline, honor, courtesy, and the other virtues are as important to us as they are to any other order, but we are also expected to be able to coexist with the rest of our church, and Heartwarders can be some of the staunchest individualists in the Realms. 'Twas a difficult lesson at times, but one better learned as a child than as an adult.~
@2775 = ~Not quite as eventful as you might expect. Sir Evendur took me on when I was a teenager, though I cannot say that I personally saw a great deal of battle. Unlike the Radiant Heart, we do not have a standing army, and tend to focus upon larger, more terrible evils in any case. Truly, a dragon's den is no place for a squire, though waiting outside with the horses has its own lessons on patience, bravery, and humility to impart.~
@2776 = ~(laugh) Not as such, no, but after eight years, one begins to pick up such habits. Friends and family have made jests about it in the past, but I can only manage to slip out of it for a few moments before reverting.~
@2777 = ~I... truly would not be the best judge of that. The Firehair expects us not to hide ourselves away, and we take that commandment very seriously. Whether we entirely succeed, I could not say.~
@2778 = ~(laugh) It very nearly changes from one tenday to the next, I must admit. Our clerics are... unpredictable, to say the least.~
@2779 = ~Does working with such a chaotic church ever get irritating?~
@2780 = ~Who else worships her?~
@2781 = ~The rumors of wild Sunite revelry aren't exaggerated, I take it.~
@2782 = ~It has its own trials and rewards, I should think.~
@2783 = ~Lovers, artists, bards and minstrels, and far more adventurers than one might have expected.~
@2784 = ~That would depend upon the rumor in question, I think. There is revelry, aye, and some of it is certainly too wild for my tastes, but the most sacred of our festivals are actually quite quiet affairs.~
@2785 = ~Are you ever tempted to pray for romantic advice?~
@2786 = ~Do you ever pray for romantic advice?~
@2787 = ~Aren't you a bit casual about taking lovers?~
@2788 = ~Your ex, the Tyrran... do I need to worry about running into him in the Radiant Heart's headquarters?~
@2789 = ~Isra, have you ever been involved with someone who *wasn't* extremely religious?~
@2790 = ~As much as I appreciate the attention, I'd rather you didn't flirt with me in public.~
@2791 = ~I miss your attention, Isra. Could you flirt with me some more?~
@2792 = ~Would you like to spend the night together?~
@2793 = ~Would you care for a bit more... privacy tonight?~
@2794 = ~I'm sorry to say this, but I think we should go back to just being friends.~
@2795 = ~(laugh) More than merely tempted, I assure you.~
@2796 = ~I'm guessing the answer is always "go for it."~
@2797 = ~Is that why you take so long to make up your mind?~
@2798 = ~Somehow that doesn't surprise me.~
@2799 = ~The response is seldom quite as clear as that. Guidance is usually more rewarding than straight answers.~
@2800 = ~'Twas a small part of it, mayhap. I do like to savor such things for at least a little while.~
@2801 = ~Nor should it.~
@2802 = ~(laugh) Don't you, my love?~
@2803 = ~Casual? I would not say that exactly. I am very selective, but love itself... marriage can be a beautiful thing, but there is more to love than that.~
@2804 = ~No. He was squired with them, but he ultimately chose to return to Calimshan instead of taking his vows. I haven't heard from him in quite some time now, but I believe he is involved in helping slaves escape into Tethyr.~
@2805 = ~(laugh) Not to any significant degree, no. My enthusiasm can become somewhat... off-putting, I imagine, to someone who does not understand it.~
@2806 = ~(laugh) Not to any significant degree, no. I am sure you can understand why... your own devotion to nature is at least somewhat analogous, I imagine.~
@2807 = ~(laugh) Evidently so. But before you... no, not to any significant degree. I suppose that is not entirely surprising.~
@2808 = ~Oh. Of course. Forgive me for the impertinence.~
@2809 = ~(laugh) You certainly needn't ask me twice.~
@2810 = ~Oh. Oh, I... see. Is there nothing I can say to convince you to reconsider?~
@2811 = ~I'm afraid not.~
@2812 = ~Never mind. I didn't mean it.~
@2813 = ~Then... then I suppose that is all there is to it. I'm sorry.~
@2814 = ~Good. You shouldn't scare me like that, <CHARNAME>.~
@2815 = ~I... don't believe so.~
@2816 = ~Yes?~
@2817 = ~(Watch her)~
@2818 = ~(Smile at her)~
@2819 = ~(Kiss her hand)~
@2820 = ~(Bow to her extravagantly)~
@2821 = ~(Offer her a flower)~
@2822 = ~Would you like me to fix your hair?~
@2823 = ~(Knock on her armor)~
@2824 = ~(Wink at her)~
@2825 = ~(Hug her)~
@2826 = ~(Kiss her cheek)~
@2827 = ~(Gesture for her to drop to one knee and then kiss her cheek)~

@2830 = ~(Stroke her cheek)~
@2831 = ~(Kiss her lips)~

@2833 = ~(Suggestively draw her hand towards your body)~
@2834 = ~(Offer to help her bath)~
@2835 = ~(Offer to help her bathe)~
@2836 = ~(There are people in the Realms who seem to demand attention simply by existing. They may do nothing in particular to draw such consideration, but every eye in a room would turn to them regardless.)~
@2837 = ~(Isra is one of them. She is beautiful by any definition, but even more arresting is the utter conviction with which she approaches everything. It is a trait that all paladins share, certainly, but Isra has little use for false modesty. She is not exactly arrogant; she would be less striking, perhaps, if she were, but hers is the walk of a woman very accustomed to being noticed.)~
@2838 = ~(Unsuprisingly, perhaps, you find your eye drawn once more to Isra. Where she finds the time to cultivate her appearance, you could not say, though the result is obvious. She does not use a great deal of cosmetics, though what she does wear, she wears to great effect... the Calishite kohl, evoking her family's ancestral homeland, the lip stain, just a shade too deep to be considered modest.)~
@2839 = ~(You find that Isra has paused momentarily to adjust her pack, though she smiles and shakes her head when you take a step closer, as if to help her. As she struggles briefly with the straps, you cannot help but notice how relatively short and slight she is for a human... another legacy of her Calishite heritage, no doubt. The difference is not normally noticeable -- height is of no consequence when you are as fond of weapons as Isra is -- but it is there nonetheless.)~
@2840 = ~(To<DAYNIGHT> when you turn to regard Isra, you find her already watching you. She blushes slightly -- a rarity for her -- before offering you a slightly playful smile.)~
@2841 = ~(To<DAYNIGHT> when you turn to regard Isra, you find her already watching you, her expression thoughtful. She laughs when your eyes meet, offering you a slightly playful smile.)~
@2842 = ~(Wordlessly, Isra smiles at you in return. Your good humor is apparently contagious, you realize, as her smile takes several long moments to fade.)~
@2843 = ~(By the warm smile that graces her own lips in response, Isra clearly appreciates your attention.)~
@2844 = ~You should do that more often, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. It becomes you.~
@2845 = ~(Isra's own smile is slightly arched, though the mirth in her eyes is sincere.)~
@2846 = ~Take care, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. You all but spoil me with such attention.~
@2847 = ~(Your smile draws Isra's attention, and she watches you for a long moment, her expression one of obvious warm admiration.)~
@2848 = ~(You drop to one knee with a gentlemanly flourish, taking Isra's hand in your own. She watches you, her manner appropriately dignified, though you can sense her restrained amusement as you press your lips to the back of her hand.)~
@2849 = ~(There is little clear protocol concerning acts of chivalry between two women, though the incongruity of the gesture does not seem to bother Isra. She watches you, her manner appropriately dignified, though you can sense her restrained amusement as you press your lips to the back of her hand.)~
@2850 = ~(Unsurprisingly, you find Isra's hand heavily callused, the hint of what can only be faded scars scattered across its back. She smiles when you bring it to your lips, clearly touched by the chivalrous gesture.)~
@2851 = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>... you needn't play this game on my behalf. If I truly needed such gallantries, I would be dining with the aristocracy right now instead.~
@2852 = ~(Isra bows her head to you in acknowledgement, the gesture almost as elegant as a full curtsy, and you sense that this is a position that she has found herself in many times before. Her expression is coolly thoughtful, but her small smile as you press your lips to the back of her hand is sincere.)~
@2853 = ~(Isra shakes her head helplessly, not bothering to hide her laughter.)~
@2854 = ~(laugh) If you wish me to curtsy in response, my <PRO_LADYLORD>, I'm afraid you are going to be sadly disappointed.~
@2855 = ~Oh, dear. I shall have to teach you to be properly ridiculous one day, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. I'm afraid you're laying it on just a little bit too thickly.~
@2856 = ~(Isra quirks an eyebrow at your antics, though you win an amused smile from her regardless.)~
@2857 = ~(smile) I did not know that roses grew here... I must assume that you've kept this hidden away in your pack since we left Athkatla. Thank you, <CHARNAME>.~
@2858 = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>... you shouldn't wander off alone like that, even in search of such lovely gifts.~
@2859 = ~(smile) It has been some time since I last had flowers laid at my feet like that... mayhap I missed it more than I realized.~
@2860 = ~(laugh) And what shall I do with it, pray tell? Regardless, you have my thanks.~
@2861 = ~(laugh) I am sure we don't have the time for that, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. This plait would take some while to unravel, much less retwine.~
@2862 = ~I appreciate the offer, my Lord, though I imagine I would have to teach you how to first. I doubt that women's grooming was much of a priority in Candlekeep.~
@2863 = ~I would appreciate that, aye... though I would reserve the right to play with yours at least once in return.~
@2864 = ~(Smiling gratefully, she carefully hands you the couple of strands that had been frustrating her. She doesn't seem to expect you to do anything with it, but a simple extra hand lets her fix matters that much more quickly.)~
@2865 = ~(She clasps your hand after she has finished, pressing it to her lips in a silent gesture of gratitude.)~
@2866 = ~(Isra looks slightly panicked at your offer, but a quick glance at a mirror reassures her that her hair remains in at least halfway decent shape. She shakes her head, eyeing you with cool bemusement.)~
@2867 = ~That is quite alright, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.~
@2868 = ~Are you quite alright, <CHARNAME>? If you are... addled in some way, mayhap we should visit the Ilmatari.~
@2869 = ~(laugh) Mayhap this strange creature is trying to communicate! Alas, it does not seem to be capable of human speech, though its features certainly are those of a typical <PRO_RACE>. 'Tis most odd, truly.~
@2870 = ~If you are quite finished, I thought there were significantly more important matters that demanded our attention.~
@2871 = ~(sigh) Truly, <CHARNAME>, this... childishness is hardly warranted. Please stop.~
@2872 = ~(Isra half smiles in return, shaking her head in mild bemusement.)~
@2873 = ~(Isra is somewhat too dignified to roll her eyes at you, but the sudden slight tilt of her eyebrows tells you that she would like to.)~
@2874 = ~If you have something in your eye, my <PRO_LADYLORD>, I would be quite happy to remove it for you.~
@2875 = ~(Quirking an eyebrow at you, Isra responds with quick and ironic flourish.)~
@2876 = ~(Isra tenses when you embrace her, pulling away as if she is afraid you might accidentally damage her armor... or perhaps be damaged by it.)~
@2877 = ~(Isra shakes her head in mild annoyance but does not bother to complain.)~
@2878 = ~Come now, <CHARNAME>. We haven't the time for this right now.~
@2879 = ~(sigh) 'Twould be awkward, were an enemy to stumble upon us like this.~
@2880 = ~(Isra smiles, lightly brushing her fingers across her cheek afterward.)~
@2881 = ~(Isra rests her hand upon your shoulder, holding you close for a brief moment afterward before letting you go.)~
@2882 = ~(Her fingers resting on your jaw, Isra tilts your head gently, brushing her lips against your own in a kiss that is somehow simultaneously chaste and intimate.)~
@2883 = ~There now, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. That is how it is done within the Church of Sune.~
@2884 = ~(You can almost feel the smile that spreads across her face at your kiss.)~
@2885 = ~'Tis the sort of greeting I could become used to, <CHARNAME>.~
@2886 = ~(She eyes you skeptically for a moment, and it is little wonder, given the exceptionally bawdy tune that the tavern's minstrel is playing. She shakes her head at you, her lips pursed tightly as if she is trying not to laugh.)~
@2887 = ~You will need to give me a chance to speak with the bard first, I think.~
@2888 = ~With the floor as crowded as this? I appreciate the offer, <CHARNAME>, but I don't relish the thought of spending the rest of the evening apologizing to everybody we accidentally knock over.~
@2889 = ~(Isra's eyes brighten considerably at the request, and she offers you her hand, the gesture unconsciously courtly. It hardly seems to bother her that the music itself is rustic, and she knows the steps to the simple country dance at least as well as anybody else on the dance floor.)~
@2890 = ~While wearing armor? You'll have to let me change into something more appropriate first, I'm afraid.~
@2891 = ~(This she does quickly, emerging from the inn's private rooms several moments later clad in a wine red dress she is particularly fond of. By the covert glances that several of the tavern's patrons toss her way, she is not the only one that approves of it.)~
@2892 = ~(She saunters over to you, and with a slightly ironic smile, sinks into a deep, well-practiced curtsy that is utterly at odds with her expression.)~
@2893 = ~Shall we, my <PRO_LADYLORD>?~
@2894 = ~(smile) Sometimes I think I am far too easily charmed by a handsome man with a harp in his hands.~
@2895 = ~(smile) Sometimes I think I am far too easily charmed by a beautiful woman with a harp in her hands.~
@2896 = ~(Isra listens quietly, watching you with a surprisingly tender expression.)~
@2897 = ~Mmm, you had best be careful, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. I may yet come to expect such performances from you.~
@2898 = ~(That Isra recognizes the song is unsurprising; her knowledge of music is very nearly encyclopedic. She draws closer, quietly beginning to sing alongside you. Her voice is not perfect by any means, but its warmth is unmistakable.)~
@2899 = ~(She smiles at you once the last notes have played, stealing a quick kiss before reluctantly return to her place in hand.)~
@2900 = ~(Isra smiles, catching your fingers in her own and pressing them gently against her lips.)~
@2901 = ~(Isra raises her own hand instinctively to touch her face, though her smile fades when her fingers come back smudged with dirt. She tosses you a reproachful look before wiping away the grime.)~
@2902 = ~(She pulls you closer for a brief moment, pressing a kiss against your own cheek in response.)~
@2903 = ~(She sighs quietly, and her smile takes several moments to fade.)~
@2904 = ~(She tangles a hand in your hair, holding you close for a long moment. When she finally releases you, her cheeks are slightly flushed.)~
@2905 = ~(Isra sighs, nipping playfully at your lower lip.)~
@2906 = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>... you are such a sweet distraction at times.~
@2907 = ~(She catches your chin in her hand, savoring the kiss for a long moment.)~
@2908 = ~(Isra murmurs happily, trailing her fingertips gently across the back of your neck as she returns your kiss.)~
@2909 = ~(In the relative safety of the tavern, Isra has stripped down to her gambeson, though the padded material is still too bulky for you to get much of a feel for what lies beneath it.)~
@2910 = ~(Isra smiles at you, her eyes drifting from your face to your hands.)~
@2911 = ~Alas for the demands of propriety, my love. I don't think that I'm ready for the entire tavern to see my corset just yet.~
@2912 = ~(With a peal of laughter, Isra bats your hands away.)~
@2913 = ~(Isra squirms momentarily in your embrace, the flimsy red garments she favors on particularly warm evenings shifting in interesting ways. She finally settles down, trailing her fingers somewhat suggestively across your chest.)~
@2914 = ~(Isra squirms momentarily in your embrace, the flimsy red garments she favors on particularly warm evenings shifting in interesting ways. She finally settles down, trailing her fingers somewhat suggestively across your hip.)~
@2915 = ~(She twists in your arms, pressing kisses along the length of your jaw.)~
@2916 = ~Why, <CHARNAME>, I did not realize that you so enjoyed the touch of cold metal. I shall have to remember that.~
@2917 = ~(smile) And to think, my Lord, I would have almost taken you for a properly gallant gentleman. This is, however, far more interesting...~
@2918 = ~(smile) And to think, <CHARNAME>, I would have almost taken you for a respectable young lady. This is, however, far more interesting...~
@2919 = ~(Isra raises an eyebrow at you. As soon as her fingers brush the fabric of your clothing, she pulls her hand away, her lips twitching in silent laughter.)~
@2920 = ~(Shamelessly tracing the outline of your body with her fingertips, Isra takes a step forward, drawing you closer for an unsurprisingly ardent kiss.)~
@2921 = ~(Shamelessly tracing the outline of your body with her fingertips, Isra drops to one knee, drawing you closer for an unsurprisingly ardent kiss.)~
@2922 = ~I did not realize that such a simple thing required two people, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.~
@2923 = ~(laugh) You wish to help, my <PRO_LADYLORD>? Or to watch?~
@2924 = ~No matter. I would appreciate the company either way.~
@2925 = ~Well, I do seem to have run out of rose oil. I believe there is a merchant in the Bridge District who sells the stuff--~
@2926 = ~(laugh) I'm jesting, <CHARNAME>. You needn't look so disappointed. Of course you can help.~
@2927 = ~(Isra kisses you in response, her fingers trailing suggestively down your chest.)~
@2928 = ~There is a bathhouse nearby that comes particularly well recommended. If we are going to do this, we might as well do it properly.~
@2929 = ~(Isra kisses you in response, her fingertips trailing gently across your jaw.)~
@2930 = ~Ohh... I do think that can be very easily arranged.~
@2931 = ~(sigh) I'm afraid I'm somewhat weary, <CHARNAME>. Tomorrow, mayhap.~
@2932 = ~Mmm... I can think of nothing I would like to do more, my love.~
@2933 = ~(She pulls you close in response, trailing her fingers absently through your hair. A brief kiss later, she tosses you a lopsided smile and gestures towards the tavern's private rooms.)~
