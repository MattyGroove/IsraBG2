@5    = ~I am tired. And I'm not interested in talking right now.~
@6    = ~(smile) Terrible words for any Sunite to hear, though recent days have been far harsher upon you than upon me.~

@8    = ~Aye, to put it mildly, though 'tis more than the location that worries me.~
@9    = ~Your thoughts must weigh more heavily upon you than you realize, though I can't blame you for that.~
@10   = ~I see. I shan't trouble you further, then. Good night, <CHARNAME>.~

@16   = ~That is true enough. And if it is not one thing, 'tis apparently another, and this new threat...~
@17   = ~That is encouraging, at least. If it is not one thing, 'tis apparently another, and this new threat...~
@18   = ~That is certainly understandable. If it is not one thing, 'tis apparently another, and this new threat...~

@83   = ~That she would damn him at the end, strip him of his soul, of his love, of the very means to seek redemption, all in an attempt to save him... I think it a cruel jest, <CHARNAME>.~

@105  = ~Unfortunately, we can't ask Prism if he would take it back.~
@106  = ~Is there even such a thing as false love?~
@107  = ~That's a very subjective definition of truth.~

@109  = ~Would that I could say. I did not know her well enough to ask.~
@110  = ~Truth be told, I do not think he would.~
@111  = ~Aye. That which doesn't inspire, or redeem, or even simply warm... there are reasons I focus upon Ellesime rather than Irenicus.~
@112  = ~I think perhaps it has to be.~
@113  = ~I would regret the ruin. The rest... no, I do not think so.~

@133  = ~My own foolish presumptions. For one who worships love, I fear I leave much to be desired.~
@134  = ~Oh. Of course. Later, then.~
@135  = ~You and I... I thought I wanted something simple, you know. Something safe. Something comfortable and uncomplicated. Something utterly in the moment.~
@136  = ~I told you as much when we were still in Amn. But after everything that happened in Spellhold, the madness that followed...~
@137  = ~I should have realized that I would not be permitted to simply follow my heart as far as I desired and not a step further.~
@138  = ~Sune is a dangerous goddess to tempt with that sort of willfulness.~
@139  = ~You told me once that you had little to offer me... has that changed?~
@140  = ~And here I thought you had always believed in romance.~

@145  = ~Aye, I would not deny that, though what that actually means...~

@147  = ~I do not mean to alarm you. I only want you to understand why this is so strange to me.~
@148  = ~Must you be quite so calm about it, Isra?~
@149  = ~I do understand. I feel very much the same.~
@150  = ~I won't let you die. I haven't yet and I'm not going to start now.~
@151  = ~Why what is so strange to you?~
@152  = ~There is little point in denying it. It is what it is.~
@153  = ~I thought that you would.~
@154  = ~Truly, I appreciate the thought, but there is little point in denying the reality of the situation.~
@155  = ~The questions that are beginning to plague me now.~
@156  = ~I have never wanted much out of life, you know. I have never expected much, but now... I love you, <CHARNAME>. I have for some time.~
@157  = ~(sigh) I like to think that I can walk away should circumstances demand it, but this time... I am not sure that I can. That frightens me more than I would care to admit.~
@158  = ~Don't be afraid to have your world shaken up a bit, Isra.~
@159  = ~This doesn't mean that things have to change between us, does it?~
@160  = ~You're allowed to want a future, Isra. A real future.~
@161  = ~You mean you would have been able to before?~
@162  = ~'Twould be blasphemy to fear it too much, I think.~
@163  = ~I do not know, <CHARNAME>. I wish that I did.~
@164  = ~To want one, aye. But to expect one...~
@165  = ~Not gladly, but... there are reasons my romances fall apart.~
@166  = ~Mayhap I am simply more closely wedded to the concept of sacrifice than I had realized. Where that leaves us, however... would that I knew.~
@167  = ~You should know by now that I'll take whatever you can offer.~
@168  = ~You are beginning to sound like a Tormite, my love.~
@169  = ~We have the goddess of love on our side. I think we'll be fine.~
@170  = ~If that's all you can say after this much time, I doubt it leaves us much of anywhere at all.~
@171  = ~(smile) I do. And I shall offer whatever I can.~
@172  = ~(laugh) That is not necessarily a bad thing.~
@173  = ~(laugh) I wonder where I might have picked that tendency up.~
@174  = ~(smile) I hope so, though I would never presume.~
@175  = ~I... I see. If that is how you feel, my <PRO_LADYLORD>, then I shall trouble you no more.~
@176  = ~I do not normally speak in riddles, but just this once... tell me, <CHARNAME>, if you knew a battle was lost before it was even begun, would you be willing to fight it anyway?~ [rh#is206]
@177  = ~I would, yes. You shouldn't even need to ask.~
@178  = ~You won't get angry if I say 'no', will you?~
@179  = ~You sound like a genie I once met in Irenicus's dungeon.~
@180  = ~I don't believe that any battle is truly unwinnable.~
@181  = ~Isra, can't this wait until a better time?~
@182  = ~Mayhap not, but... I have been thinking.~
@183  = ~No. I would never want you to tell me simply what you thought I wanted to hear. But... I have been thinking.~
@184  = ~(laugh) I am not quite as inscrutable as that. But I have been thinking.~
@185  = ~An admirable belief, though... I am not sure that I agree.~
@186  = ~Aye, I suppose it can.~
@187  = ~I have been watching this unfold, plot within plot, scheme after scheme to unravel, our enemies seemingly as numberless as the layers of the Abyss.~
@188  = ~And that is a frightening thought itself when one stops to consider it. A legion of demons, each clamoring over the others, countless as the grains of sand in the Calim Desert...~
@189  = ~Sometimes I wonder if this is a war that can even be won at all.~
@190  = ~I take it you're not still talking about the Bhaalspawn crisis.~
@191  = ~And if it isn't? What then?~
@192  = ~Nobody's planning on conquering the Abyss, Isra.~
@193  = ~It shouldn't surprise me to find you thinking holy war.~
@194  = ~No... no, I am speaking more generally.~
@195  = ~What then, indeed.~
@196  = ~Aye, nobody save the devils of Baator, but it is still worth more than a passing thought.~
@197  = ~Given the challenges we have faced as of late, perhaps it should not.~
@198  = ~For every problem that we solve, it seems that another two rise to take its place. Literally, in the case of Sendai and Abazigal.~
@199  = ~I try to focus upon the small victories, the people saved along the way, but... sometimes I wonder if this is not merely a long defeat.~
@200  = ~It makes little difference in the long run, of course. The only alternative is submission, and that... that is no alternative at all.~
@201  = ~Are you beginning to doubt that we might triumph here?~
@202  = ~Don't talk like this, Isra. I'd hate to see you grow jaded.~
@203  = ~The smaller victories mean as much as the large ones.~
@204  = ~Indeed. I, for one, don't mean to give in without a fight.~
@205  = ~Against the Bhaalspawn? I believe that we can, though I am no diviner to say that we will.~
@206  = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>. I am no stranger to thoughts like this. They do not rule me, but that does not mean I never have them.~
@207  = ~Aye, they do. I would never say otherwise, though the larger battles... those are the ones that weigh more heavily.~
@208  = ~I did not think that you would, though I am sure that you know as well as I precisely what that means.~
@209  = ~This struggle... you know, I have spent more than a few of my quietest moments hoping for a glorious death rather than a forgettable one. A beautiful tale to leave behind once I was gone. Preferably not today or tomorrow, of course, but... eventually.~
@210  = ~It seems such a petty desire at times, but I am not sure it actually is.~
@211  = ~Nor am I. We all need to believe our deaths mean something.~
@212  = ~I think you should focus more on living well, not dying well.~
@213  = ~Gods, Isra, can't you think like a normal person for once?~
@214  = ~You wouldn't rather die peacefully, surrounded by grandchildren?~
@215  = ~It does make facing it that much easier.~
@216  = ~I would agree, though death is too constant a companion not to give it a second thought.~
@217  = ~I... suppose I should have expected that.~
@218  = ~The chances of that are slim, <CHARNAME>. For any number of reasons.~
@219  = ~(sigh) But listen to me... what dreary company I am to<DAYNIGHT>. You've more than enough cause for concern without my input.~
@220  = ~Your heritage... I cannot say that I envy you the complications right now.~
@221  = ~Trust me, even these morbid thoughts are a pleasant change.~
@222  = ~You mean you envied them before?~
@223  = ~The complications apply to everyone around me also, you know.~
@224  = ~(sigh) But listen to me... what dreary company I am to<DAYNIGHT>. You've more than enough cause to think about death and dying without me adding to your list of concerns.~
@225  = ~Well, now I know my fixation on death isn't entirely due to Bhaal's taint.~
@226  = ~I can easily believe that. But come, we ought to catch up to the others lest we be left even farther behind.~
@227  = ~'Twas a mere figure of speech, <CHARNAME>. But come, we ought to catch up to the others lest we be left even farther behind.~
@228  = ~Aye, at least to a significant extent, that is true enough. But come, we ought to catch up to the others lest we be left even farther behind.~
@229  = ~Entirely... no, though I would be wary of such thoughts all the same. But come, we ought to catch up to the others lest we be left even farther behind.~
@230  = ~I thought this quest near its end once before, prior to leaving for Spellhold. Now, however... I cannot imagine it continuing much longer.~ [rh#is207]
@231  = ~You don't sound like you're looking forward to the end.~
@232  = ~If it does, it'll leave half of Tethyr in ruins.~
@233  = ~I've stopped trying to determine how close we are to an end.~
@234  = ~We'll have to run out of other Bhaalspawn sooner or later.~
@235  = ~We don't have time to talk about it right now.~
@236  = ~No, perhaps not. I want this conflict resolved as quickly as possible, but I am beginning to worry about what might come next.~
@237  = ~...aye. 'Tis somewhat selfish of me to be considering our own situation with such stakes, but I cannot help but wonder what might come next.~
@238  = ~That is likely wise of you, though... I am beginning to wonder what might come next.~
@239  = ~One would assume so, though... I am beginning to wonder what might come next.~
@240  = ~Perhaps later, then.~
@241  = ~What do you see in your future, <CHARNAME>? After this is over? Or rather, what would you wish to see, if the choice were entirely yours?~
@242  = ~I see you, Isra. The rest doesn't matter.~
@243  = ~More of the same, most likely. I enjoy a traveling life.~
@244  = ~A normal, settled life. I'm growing tired of the road.~
@245  = ~The Solar's offer of godhood is... somewhat tempting.~
@246  = ~I am as devoted to my deity as you are to yours. That choice will never be mine.~
@247  = ~I am as devoted to Sune as you are. That choice will never be mine.~
@248  = ~I do have a place at the temple in Athkatla to return to.~
@249  = ~I'd probably return to the Umar Hills. They need a ranger there.~
@250  = ~(smile) As flattering as that may be... you are still your own person. I would not wish to take that away from you.~
@251  = ~'Tis a strange life to commit oneself to, though I can certainly sympathize. Where that leaves us, however...~
@252  = ~I... thought that might have been the case.~
@253  = ~Oh. I... I had not actually considered that, I must admit.~
@254  = ~What might become of us is probably the last thing on your mind.~
@255  = ~With a choice like this, I need to decide what's right for me.~
@256  = ~I didn't think we had much of a future to consider.~
@257  = ~My dreams of divinity are probably just that, Isra. Dreams.~
@258  = ~It kind of is a lower priority, yes.~
@259  = ~And with both of us with such obligations... sometimes I think it little wonder many paladins like the reliability of a home and family to return to, even if they seldom find the time for it.~
@260  = ~I cannot be that for you, <CHARNAME>. Anymore than you could be it for me.~
@261  = ~I cannot fault you for wanting to return to the Lathandrites, even if it means I might not see you as much as I would like.~
@262  = ~(smile) You would have a place at our temple in Crimmor as well, even if it meant I would not see you as much as I might like.~
@263  = ~That is as worthwhile a desire as any, even if it means I might not see you as much as I would like.~
@264  = ~I have said more than once that I've little in the way of stability or permanence to offer you, and that remains as true now as it did before.~
@265  = ~Once this quest is finished, I couldn't begin to predict where I might go next. Hopefully our paths will stay entwined for at least a while longer, but... I can promise very little.~
@266  = ~Only that I do not fall out of love very easily, even if circumstances were to keep us apart.~
@267  = ~Can't we wait to worry about that until it happens?~
@268  = ~Wherever you end up, I fully intend to follow you.~
@269  = ~Stop being so melodramatic. Your life isn't quite that insane.~
@270  = ~If you can't commit to staying beside me, this isn't worth it.~
@271  = ~This was never meant to be permanent. Let's just enjoy what time we do have.~
@272  = ~You know that I do not mean to settle myself... not in Athkatla, not even in Crimmor, as much as I love it there. I've said before that I've little in the way of stability or permanence to offer you, and that remains as true now as it did then.~
@273  = ~I would like to be able to say that our love can survive the strain of that, but... I don't know. All I know is that I can't make myself walk away from you. Not unless you tell me to.~
@274  = ~I can wait to settle. You're bound to retire eventually.~
@275  = ~If things fall apart, so be it, but we should at least try.~
@276  = ~That sounds like a lonely arrangement. Too lonely.~
@277  = ~If you can't actually commit to me, this isn't worth it.~
@278  = ~We can, aye, though the possibility is something I would rather discuss sooner than later.~
@279  = ~(laugh) Were I in any other order, I doubt that would be quite so simple, but no member of the Ruby Rose is likely to comment upon it.~
@280  = ~Mayhap I am simply borrowing trouble, but I would rather not pretend that potential problems do not exist.~
@281  = ~I... see. If that is the way you view matters, then... then I suppose that is all there is to it. I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>.~
@282  = ~(sigh) I suppose that is all we can do.~
@283  = ~I've no wish to tie you to a life you do not want, <CHARNAME>... and a dangerous one, at that. Especially when the future you hope for may or may not ever come to pass.~
@284  = ~We should, aye. I would like nothing better, though... I do not expect it to be easy.~
@285  = ~I... cannot blame you for feeling that way, <CHARNAME>. As much as I might wish you did not. Once this is over... if you wish me to leave, I will.~
@286  = ~No! That would be even worse. We can at least try.~
@287  = ~That might be best. Let's just enjoy what time we do have.~
@288  = ~If you can't commit to me, this isn't worth it at all.~

@291  = ~Many believe us to be better at balancing life and love than knights of other orders, but I am not so sure. Neglecting a romance until it withers and dies... when that is the likely outcome, 'tis no wonder that so many commit themselves to the ideal of love instead of the reality.~

@293  = ~You won't fail me, Isra. I don't think you even know how to.~
@294  = ~I would end up with the one crazy Sunite, wouldn't I?~
@295  = ~You're allowed to make mistakes. Don't idealize love to the point that you're afraid of it.~
@296  = ~I don't want to fail you either, and there's far more chance of that.~
@297  = ~Isra, you're too young to already worry about things like this.~
@298  = ~(smile) Then I shall have to trust to your judgment in this. That much, my love... that much I think I can manage.~
@299  = ~Make light of it, if you wish. Mayhap that truly is the only answer.~
@300  = ~Aye, there may be some truth to what you say, my love. There usually is. I shall need to keep your words in mind.~
@301  = ~I do not believe that, though mayhap we are both somewhat more doubtful than we should be. 'Tis something to consider, at least.~
@302  = ~I... am not sure if there is such a thing as too young, my love. But if I must trust your judgment in this... that much I think I can manage.~
@303  = ~No... no, I would agree with that.~
@304  = ~If the thought of godhood tempts you, perhaps we do not.~
@305  = ~I would not be so certain of that. If we survive this, I dare say anything is possible.~
@306  = ~I... I see. I shall leave you be, then.~
@307  = ~I would not be the first Sunite to lose someone she loved to godhood. During the Time of Troubles... all tales speak of Mystra, Cyric, and now Kelemvor, who became deities in the aftermath.~
@308  = ~Of Adon, the fourth of their number... we do not think very highly of him within the Church of Sune anymore. He left us, taking up the worship of Mystra instead.~
@309  = ~I... could not do the same, <CHARNAME>. As much as I love you, I simply could not.~
@310  = ~I understand. I would not ask you to.~

@321  = ~I think a longer vacation than that is warranted.~
@322  = ~There's really nothing I would like more right now.~
@323  = ~Isra, can we talk later instead?~
@324  = ~Crimmor, preferably. At least for the moment.~
@325  = ~I would grow restless, I fear. I don't care for taking more time than I need... though I will need some soon, I think.~

@327  = ~Aye, if you would prefer it.~
@328  = ~I would have expected to be eager to show you our temple, but oddly enough, 'tis the Crytrapper estate that captures my imagination instead. Particularly its stables.~
@329  = ~(smile) I should like to see just how well you ride, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. You are a <PRO_MANWOMAN> of the woods, so I don't envision being terribly disappointed, but I must warn you that I have never actually been outraced before.~
@330  = ~(smile) I should like to see just how well you ride, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. I don't envision being terribly disappointed, but I must warn you that I have never actually been outraced before.~

@339  = ~No, I imagine that would not have been a welcome sight at all.~
@340  = ~'Tis a poor time, mayhap, to be planning such diversions, but... well. Should it come to pass that stolen moments are all we can afford, I would have each of them be as beautiful as possible.~

@342  = ~What is life but a sequence of stolen moments anyway?~
@343  = ~I really don't see how they could be anything else.~
@344  = ~Really, Isra. We have more important things to worry about now.~
@345  = ~(smile) I hope so as well, though even if we do not... 'twould be enough, I think.~
@346  = ~(smile) Especially lives such as ours, <CHARNAME>.~
@347  = ~(smile) Nor do I, truly. And even if that is all there is... 'twould be enough, I think.~
@348  = ~You are right, of course. Forgive me.~
@349  = ~The poets always sing of lovers who can't bear ever to be parted... of love that endures throughout the ages. And as beautiful as those songs are, the alternative...

@350  = ~I hope... I am not sure what exactly I am hoping for, <CHARNAME>, but I am glad to be here. With you. No matter what might come next. I wanted you to know that.~

@363  = ~You're not losing your nerve now, are you?~
@364  = ~I don't think we have the time to spare for this.~

@374  = ~I know that you want more than I can offer you, and I cannot blame you for that. Whatever I might like, whatever I might want...~
@375  = ~I will never forget you, <CHARNAME>. The memory of this... it will not be darkened by the fact that it had to end.~
@376  = ~Whatever I said, forget it. I don't want to leave you.~
@377  = ~I won't forget either. I can promise that.~
@378  = ~I don't need your guilt trips now, Isra.~

@382  = ~Oh, I wouldn't say that, though regardless... kiss me once more, <CHARNAME>, in case things do not play out in our favor.~
@383  = ~Oh! 'Tis a far more welcome answer than any I had hoped to hear. But kiss me once more anyway, <CHARNAME>... in case things do not play out in our favor.~
@384  = ~Then that will have to be enough.~
@385  = ~I didn't-- very well, we will speak no more of it.~
@386  = ~(smile) Your lips are stained red now, my love... mayhap I should wipe that away before the others find reason to comment.~

@396  = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>... we have tarried almost too long as it is. Briefly, my Lord, and then we must be off. There will be time to speak later, I am sure.~
@397  = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>... I don't have the words to tell you how magnificent you are. Or the time.~
@398  = ~Come, we have tarried almost too long as it is. There will be a chance to speak later, I am sure.~

@406  = ~Poor, naive little Izzy, with so much faith in her own family's influence. I betrayed the Jysstevs. Did you not think that they would take vengeance themselves?~
@407  = ~No... no, they can't have...~
@408  = ~They are dangerous people to cross. You knew that when I married one. You should have tried harder to talk me out of it. I would still be alive if you had succeeded.~

@427  = ~Your sister will come around in time. I'm sure of it.~
@428  = ~Stop worrying about her so, Isra. It makes it easier for our enemies.~
@429  = ~I... have, aye. Once or twice. 'Tis the remotest of possibilities, though it should not surprise me that the wraith latched upon it.~
@430  = ~That is as accurate a description as any.~
@431  = ~I... can only hope so. The possibility that she might not... it should not surprise me that the wraith latched upon it.~
@432  = ~I know. That much is clear.~
@433  = ~I was like an open book to that creature. How it could look at me and simply know those things... my mind is apparently not as guarded as I had thought.~

@470  = ~Through being one of the very few willing to do anything at all, I suspect.~
@471  = ~(sigh) I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>. I should not keep you awake so. I intend to stand vigil tonight, but there is no reason for you to do the same.~
@472  = ~If you mean to stay up all night, I'd rather stay with you.~
@473  = ~Very well. At least stay close, then.~
@474  = ~There's every reason for me to do the same.~
@475  = ~Get some rest, Isra. You can't change the past with a gesture.~
@476  = ~Then come closer. I would have you near tonight... to dull the memory if not to ward it off entirely.~
@477  = ~I intend to. My arms are as comfortable a bed as any we are likely to find. I would have you near tonight anyway... to dull the memory if not to ward it off entirely.~

@562  = ~(She drops her pack to the ground for a moment to fix a broken strap on her armor, and you catch a brief glimpse of sheer red fabric in her bag... notoriously revealing Sunite ceremonial garb, most likely. She closes the bag a moment later, laughing softly in amusement.)~
@563  = ~You are welcome to see me in it later tonight, my love.~
@564  = ~Or out of it, mayhap.~
@565  = ~Sometimes... usually, rather... I think it a shame that there are so few men within the Sunite Church. One such as you, <CHARNAME>...~
@566  = ~(smile) Needless to say, I would be the envy of any number of our priestesses right now.~
@567  = ~I have never considered myself overly conventional, you know, but it does seem in keeping with tradition that every knight must find some fair maiden to woo.~

@571  = ~(She says nothing, but her eyes follow you for a long moment, her concern obvious. She finally nods to herself, as if she has come to some decision, and turns back to the task at hand.)~
@572  = ~(She rests a hand lightly upon your shoulder, the gesture one of comfort... though it is impossible to tell whether she is seeking or giving it. Perhaps it does not matter.)~
@573  = ~(Wordlessly, she falls into step beside you, clearly enjoying the moment of companionable silence. You catch her studying you every so often, and when you catch her eye, she gives you a slightly rueful smile.)~
@574  = ~(You have seen her curtsy before, if only when out of armor, but to<DAYNIGHT> Isra bows to you instead, the gesture perhaps slightly more flamboyant than it has to be.)~
@575  = ~(Her smile still somewhat lopsided, she suddenly offers you her hand, clearly content to let you play the role of the gallant gentleman instead.)~
@576  = ~(She laughs, slipping easily out of the adopted role, and takes your hand, giving it an affectionate if somewhat more casual kiss.)~
@577  = ~(She does not say anything, content to merely admire you for a brief moment. It is only with a soft, somewhat regretful sigh that she turns away again.)~
@578  = ~("Sultry" is not a word one would normally use to describe Isra, but to<DAYNIGHT> it is surprisingly fitting. It may be the rich scent of Calishite perfume, or the gleam in her eyes as she regards you, but it is definitely there.)~
@579  = ~(She brushes her fingers against the side of your face, and if not for the demands of propriety, you guess tell that she would already be kissing you. Or more.)~

@584  = ~(Isra doesn't quite melt into your arms, but comes as close as her armor allows, tangling a hand in your hair as she returns the kiss.)~
@585  = ~(smile) Don't I? I shall have to keep that in mind, then.~
@586  = ~(Isra barely keeps herself from overbalancing, but laughs off the near fall, tangling a hand in your hair as she returns the kiss.)~
@587  = ~(After a moment, you see the handkerchief of pure white silk wrapped between her fingers... and the intricately designed scarlet rose embroidered upon it.)~
@588  = ~Take it, my love. I must be allowed the occasional concession to courtly romance... even if they are somewhat backwards by necessity.~
@589  = ~Shall I beg a kiss of you, my love? Surely we have time enough to spare for such simple pleasures?~
@590  = ~Folly compounded by cowardice... this story grows uglier by the moment.~
@591  = ~I do not care for how famous you are becoming, <CHARNAME>.~

@605  = ~Then it is fortunate that the choice is not yours.~
@606  = ~This is... there may have been no choice, but this is truly blasphemous.~
@607  = ~Aye, the victim's card, 'twould seem. Many merchants are trustworthy people, Kiser. Your... eternal curse, as you say, has nothing to do with your wealth.~
@608  = ~If you are quite done with your moralizing, my lady...~
@609  = ~That is hardly a skill that one simply... develops.~
@610  = ~No, it is not.~
@611  = ~(sigh) Another forced out onto the street in the wake of this?~
@612  = ~Powerful undead? I would wish to eliminate them even if this passage did not lead into the castle.~
@613  = ~Tell me about Isra.~
@614  = ~Ah, yes... stories about <CHARNAME> and the Lady Isra are already beginning to spread, courtesy of the bards within her own church. Her name will long be cherished within the Church of Sune, and likely by the rest of the Realms as well.~
@615  = ~You are too kind, sir.~
@616  = ~The youngest daughter of the Amnian General Ghadir, Isra has finally eclipsed her father in both fame and valor. Her name will long be cherished within the Church of Sune, and likely by the rest of the Realms as well.~
@617  = ~I have no objection to challenging the fiend, though sealing the prison may indeed prove the wiser course of action.~
@618  = ~Must we play *games* with this creature, <CHARNAME>? 'Tis a demon! Whatever pleasant face it puts forward is merely that -- a face! 'Twould be better to simply slay it and be done with it!~

@620  = ~Be careful, <CHARNAME>. There is... something... here, something almost too ancient to be named...~
@621  = ~So we have come to it at last... though mayhap it was always inevitable. Have you... have you come to a decision, <CHARNAME>?~ [rh#is213]
@622  = ~What do you think I should do?~
@623  = ~I don't want to leave you behind, Isra.~
@624  = ~I'm sorry, Isra. I have to see this through.~
@625  = ~The thought of losing you forever... 'tis almost more than I can bear. But if I were to view the matter dispassionately, you... if anyone were worthy of godhood, if anyone could turn the evil of Bhaal's essence to goodness at last, it would be you.~
@626  = ~And yet... and yet I would have you stay instead. Whatever might become of us... I would have you here, <CHARNAME>. Perhaps that is selfish of me, but I will not pretend to I feel differently.~
@627  = ~I... know. I expected that you would still feel that way.~
@628  = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>... I cannot counsel you. I can't predict what affect the taint might have upon you in the future, and yet... if anyone could turn the evil of Bhaal's essence to goodness at last, it would be you.~ [rh#is214]
@629  = ~If this power were less insidious, I would be more comfortable with the choice. But the thought of it destroying you in the end... I do not like to consider it, <CHARNAME>.~ [rh#is215]
@630  = ~Then... then this is goodbye. I wish you only the best, <CHARNAME>, though... I do not expect that we will meet again.~ [rh#is216]
@631  = ~You... oh, <CHARNAME>, my love... I can scarce believe it.~ [rh#is217]

@634  = ~What do you think of our quest?~
@635  = ~Could I ask you something personal?~

@638  = ~What do you think about our companions?~
@639  = ~Is there something wrong with your voice?~

@649  = ~Have you been enjoying the dragonslaying?~
@650  = ~What are you planning on doing after this?~
@651  = ~Actually, never mind.~
@652  = ~I have not. Tethyrians... well, many of them are not terribly fond of my faith. Whether that means the Ruby Rose should spend more or less time there, I could not say.~
@653  = ~I cannot imagine this is much fun for anybody.~
@654  = ~(laugh) My bottles are enchanted to never run dry, I must admit. I am beginning to wish I had thought to do the same with my other cosmetics, though those are considerably less crucial.~
@655  = ~I quite like her. 'Tis a minor miracle to find anybody willing to help.~
@656  = ~I... whatever obligations he has to Amkethran, he is utterly neglecting them. That speaks more to his character than anything else, I'm afraid.~
@657  = ~Very funny, <CHARNAME>. A normal dragon is bad enough, a Bhaalspawn one... I can only wonder what might be next.~
@658  = ~Returning to my order, most likely, assuming that something pressing does not come up in the meanwhile.~
@659  = ~You know that I mean to return to the Ruby Rose eventually, <CHARNAME>. What might happen after that... I cannot begin to guess.~

@680  = ~He is certainly a valuable companion.~
@681  = ~I cannot say that I understand him.~
@682  = ~Anything I have to say concerning him, my <PRO_LADYLORD>, I shall say to his face.~
@683  = ~(laugh) He is far too charming for me to be impartial, I'm afraid, though his strange philosophy... I am not sure I care for it at all.~
@684  = ~After everything that has happened to her, she hasn't lost her good nature... that says more about her strength than some might realize.~
@685  = ~I have nothing but respect for her, though I suppose that may be difficult to tell at times.~
@686  = ~I am still not sure what to make of him.~
@687  = ~My father fought alongside him once, you know. That makes things... somewhat strange, though 'tis no less of an honor.~
@688  = ~I do not see why we need his company, <CHARNAME>.~
@689  = ~She has a purer heart than many a paladin... and I dare say that probably includes myself. 'Twould be an understatement to say that I valued her company.~

@691  = ~I never can tell whether she sees me as an ally or an enemy, but I sympathize with her regardless. I wish all of Amn's nobility were of like mind.~
@692  = ~I have no great love for wild magic, though she herself is pleasant enough company.~
@693  = ~I have nothing but respect for both him and his faith. I do appreciate his company.~
@694  = ~I think he is very lonely, <CHARNAME>. Lonelier than he will admit to.~
@695  = ~The Sharran? I prefer her where I can see her, but I must warn you never to trust a word that she says.~
@696  = ~I would be happy to, of course. What would you care to know?~
@697  = ~I don't know that much about Sune.~
@698  = ~I didn't know there were paladin orders other than the Radiant Heart.~
@699  = ~Could you tell me about your novitiate?~
@700  = ~What is your church like?~
@701  = ~Aye, her worship is not nearly as widespread further north as it is here. Sune is the fairest of the gods: beautiful, passionate, and boundlessly loving. She cares for her followers on a level that is somewhat unusual for a deity, mayhap, and asks only the same in return.~
@702  = ~Isn't she a strange choice for a paladin?~
@703  = ~Could you tell me her dogma?~
@704  = ~Do you need to be beautiful to worship her?~
@705  = ~Is she very popular in Amn?~
@706  = ~I do not think so, though others might disagree. We define our devotions to our gods in so many different ways, but at heart... 'tis based either in love or fear, I believe. I have no use for the latter.~
@707  = ~She asks us to encourage love and beauty, in ourselves, in others, and in the world at large. What exactly that means... there are as many interpretations of beauty as there are Sunites, I think. We all believe that beauty is more than skin deep, that the imprint of one's soul can be seen in one's features. Some take this to literal extremes, 'tis true, but I have always felt that external beauty is marred by a poor temper or evil intent.~
@708  = ~We cherish art and do whatever we can to sponsor and protect its creators, and we dislike it when people hide themselves, their skills, or their treasures away. Beauty that is concealed does little to enrich Faerun in its entirety, nor does it truly even benefit its possessor. Enriching one another's lives... aye, for me, that is the key to understanding the Firehair's dogma, though others, even amongst the faithful, may well interpret it differently.~
@709  = ~Yes and no, I would say. There is more to beauty than mere flesh, though we are all expected to cultivate our appearances to the best of our abilities. But no, nobody with love in their heart would be turned from her worship.~
@710  = ~Exceedingly so, yes, though... not entirely for the reasons I would like, I admit.~
@711  = ~A small handful, certainly. Sune, Lathander, and Milil each sponsor orders, though none are as large or well-organized as the Radiant Heart.~
@712  = ~You never considered Torm or Tyr instead?~
@713  = ~Would the Radiant Heart turn people away on religious grounds?~
@714  = ~Milil? The god of poetry?~
@715  = ~Those are all allied churches, aren't they?~
@716  = ~The Ruby Rose won't be angry with you for wandering around unsupervised?~
@717  = ~No. Their faiths do important work, but duty and justice, without anything else behind them... I could never serve that.~
@718  = ~Not explicitly, I do not think, though 'twould be somewhat difficult for a member of a different faith to find patronage.~
@719  = ~Aye. Most songs concerning knights are inspired by those of his order... they tend to prefer to travel with bards, and seldom simply for the pleasure of their company.~
@720  = ~Aye. 'Tis why I know more about them. Lathander, Milil, Lliira, Selûne, Sharess, and several deities amongst the elven pantheon as well, though I am somewhat less familiar with the Seldarine.~
@721  = ~Were I still a squire, they would be, but we are largely permitted a degree of freedom in choosing our missions. The tenets of our faith very nearly mandate such flexibility.~
@722  = ~'Twas... trying at times, mayhap, but ultimately rewarding. I was twelve when I was entrusted to the Order of the Ruby Rose, and I had already spent several years studying under Eshpurta's finest military instructors, so weapons training was nothing out of the ordinary for me. As for religious training... in the church of Sune, 'tis more an endeavor of love than a chore.~
@723  = ~Was it different than it would have been in another order?~
@724  = ~What was your actual squiredom like?~
@725  = ~Did they teach you to talk like that too?~
@726  = ~How cloistered was it?~
@727  = ~I should think so, aye. Discipline, honor, courtesy, and the other virtues are as important to us as they are to any other order, but we are also expected to be able to coexist with the rest of our church, and Heartwarders can be some of the staunchest individualists in the Realms. 'Twas a difficult lesson at times, but one better learned as a child than as an adult.~
@728  = ~Not quite as eventful as you might expect. Sir Evendur took me on when I was a teenager, though I cannot say that I personally saw a great deal of battle. Unlike the Radiant Heart, we do not have a standing army, and tend to focus upon larger, more terrible evils in any case. Truly, a dragon's den is no place for a squire, though waiting outside with the horses has its own lessons on patience, bravery, and humility to impart.~
@729  = ~(laugh) Not as such, no, but after eight years, one begins to pick up such habits. Friends and family have made jests about it in the past, but I can only manage to slip out of it for a few moments before reverting.~
@730  = ~I... truly would not be the best judge of that. The Firehair expects us not to hide ourselves away, and we take that commandment very seriously. Whether we entirely succeed, I could not say.~
@731  = ~(laugh) It very nearly changes from one tenday to the next, I must admit. Our clerics are... unpredictable, to say the least. In Crimmor, 'tis even more evident, as we share our temple with the faithful of Lliira and Milil as well.~
@732  = ~Does working with such a chaotic church ever get irritating?~
@733  = ~Who else worships her?~
@734  = ~The rumors of wild Sunite revelry aren't exaggerated, I take it.~
@735  = ~That sounds like an odd set-up.~
@736  = ~It has its own trials and rewards, I should think.~
@737  = ~Lovers, artists, bards and minstrels, and far more adventurers than one might have expected.~
@738  = ~That would depend upon the rumor in question, I think. There is revelry, aye, and some of it is certainly too wild for my tastes, but the most sacred of our festivals are actually quite quiet affairs.~
@739  = ~Sune holds sway in the morn, Milil in the afternoon, and Lliira in the evening. The arrangement is... strangely casual, aye, though it does seem to work out well enough.~
@740  = ~Of course.~
@741  = ~You said once not to expect longterm commitment, but after everything that has happened... where is this going, Isra?~
@742  = ~I love you, Isra. Despite whatever mad insecurities you might have. I wanted you to know that.~
@743  = ~Have you really never entertained the possibility of marriage someday?~
@744  = ~As much as I appreciate the attention, I'd rather you didn't flirt with me in public.~
@745  = ~I miss your attention, Isra. Could you flirt with me some more?~
@746  = ~Would you care for a bit more... privacy tonight?~
@747  = ~I'm sorry to say this, but I think we should go back to just being friends.~
@748  = ~I wish I knew. I do not want to be parted from you, <CHARNAME>, but... well, mayhap 'tis too soon to be worried about such things now.~
@749  = ~(smile) And I, you, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. Do not doubt that for a moment.~
@750  = ~Someday, aye. I do not expect to stay tethered to this lifestyle forever, though until my heart bids me do otherwise... I am sorry, but I cannot swear vows I am not certain I will be permitted to keep.~
@751  = ~'Tis a long time to ask someone to wait, I know. I am sorry for that as well.~
@752  = ~Oh. Of course. Forgive me for the impertinence.~
@753  = ~(laugh) You certainly needn't ask me twice.~
@754  = ~Oh. Oh, I... see. Is there nothing I can say to convince you to reconsider?~
@755  = ~I'm afraid not.~
@756  = ~Never mind. I didn't mean it.~
@757  = ~Then... then I suppose that is all there is to it. I'm sorry.~
@758  = ~Good. You shouldn't scare me like that, <CHARNAME>.~
@759  = ~I... don't believe so.~
@760  = ~Yes?~

@774  = ~(Offer to help her bathe)~
@775  = ~(If Isra notices your attention, she makes no sign of it. Her eyes are fixed upon the surroundings, her lips pressed together as if she is worried about something.)~
@776  = ~(The kohl around Isra's eyes -- one of the few cosmetic items she still seems to have access to -- is smudging slightly in the Tethyrian heat. She doesn't appear to have noticed it so far, and even if she did, there is little time at present to fix it.)~
@777  = ~(You find Isra watching you, her expression both tender and concerned. She smiles when your eyes meet, and then quickly turns to examine her weapons instead.)~
@778  = ~(Despite Isra's Calishite heritage, you can tell that the arid Tethyrian climate is taking its toll on her. She hasn't complained yet and likely never will, but you find her looking somewhat more tired than usual.)~
@779  = ~Oh, my <PRO_LADYLORD>, I would almost take that smile as an open invitation.~
@780  = ~(Isra returns your smile easily, drawing near you to rest her hand upon your shoulder for a brief moment.)~
@781  = ~(Isra smiles back readily enough, though the expression fades from her face almost immediately afterwards, replaced by the worry that has so often characterized it as of late.)~
@782  = ~(Your smile draws Isra's attention, and she watches you for a long moment, her expression one of obvious warm admiration.)~
@783  = ~(You drop to one knee with a gentlemanly flourish, taking Isra's hand in your own. She watches you, her manner appropriately dignified, though you can sense her restrained amusement as you press your lips to the back of her hand.)~
@784  = ~(There is little clear protocol concerning acts of chivalry between two women, though the incongruity of the gesture does not seem to bother Isra. She watches you, her manner appropriately dignified, though you can sense her restrained amusement as you press your lips to the back of her hand.)~
@785  = ~(Unsurprisingly, you find Isra's hand heavily callused, the hint of what can only be faded scars scattered across its back. She smiles when you bring it to your lips, clearly touched by the chivalrous gesture.)~
@786  = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>... really, this is hardly the time or place for such games.~
@787  = ~(Isra bows her head to you in acknowledgement, the gesture almost as elegant as a full curtsy, and you sense that this is a position that she has found herself in many times before. Her expression is coolly thoughtful, but her small smile as you press your lips to the back of her hand is sincere.)~
@788  = ~(Isra shakes her head helplessly, not bothering to hide her laughter.)~
@789  = ~(laugh) If you wish me to curtsy in response, my <PRO_LADYLORD>, I'm afraid you are going to be sadly disappointed.~
@790  = ~Oh, dear. I shall have to teach you to be properly ridiculous one day, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. I'm afraid you're laying it on just a little bit too thickly.~
@791  = ~(Isra quirks an eyebrow at your antics, though you win an amused smile from her regardless.)~
@792  = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>... you shouldn't wander off alone like that, even in search of such lovely gifts.~
@793  = ~(sigh) Sometimes it amazes me that such things still grow in Tethyr.~
@794  = ~Careful now, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. These braids are difficult enough in decent shape as it is.~
@795  = ~(As you twine several loose strands of her hair around your fingers, Isra brings her hand up to cup your own. She holds it for a brief moment before pulling her hair free of your grasp.)~
@796  = ~(As your fingers brush against her braid, Isra sweeps it from your grasp, fixing you with a slightly stern look.)~
@797  = ~I will never understand why you are so fond of doing that, <CHARNAME>.~
@798  = ~(Isra half smiles in return, shaking her head in mild bemusement.)~
@799  = ~(Isra is somewhat too dignified to roll her eyes at you, but the sudden slight tilt of her eyebrows tells you that she would like to.)~
@800  = ~If you have something in your eye, my <PRO_LADYLORD>, I would be quite happy to remove it for you.~
@801  = ~(Quirking an eyebrow at you, Isra responds with quick and ironic flourish.)~

@815  = ~(She sighs quietly, and her smile takes several moments to fade.)~
